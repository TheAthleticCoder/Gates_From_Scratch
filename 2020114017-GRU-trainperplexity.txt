the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta ' s recent primary election produced `` no evidence ' ' that any irregularities took place .	95.10011
the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta ' ' for the manner in which the election was conducted .	53.18753
the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities ' ' in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen jr . .	23.542988
`` only a relative handful of such reports was received ' ' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city ' ' .	29.329586
the jury said it did find that many of georgia ' s registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ' ' .	43.07729
it recommended that fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them ' ' .	47.428333
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ' ' .	75.15064
however , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ' ' .	29.384985
the city purchasing department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ' ' .	36.7207
it urged that the city `` take steps to remedy ' ' this problem .	25.569384
implementation of georgia ' s automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .	17.908604
it urged that the next legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected ' ' .	28.701744
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare department ' s handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .	46.405537
`` this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program ' ' , the jury said , but the state welfare department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county , which receives none of this money .	46.33961
the jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties ' ' .	40.985516
nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds ' ' , the jurors said .	42.043976
`` failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden ' ' on fulton taxpayers .	36.447414
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary ' s court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .	24.90433
the jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations ' ' of two previous grand juries , the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee .	96.27602
`` these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court ' s wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms ' ' , the jury said .	52.420998
regarding atlanta ' s new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge jan . 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences ' ' .	55.549118
the jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ' ' .	23.513292
on other matters , the jury recommended that ( 1 )	16.026085
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail ' ' .	30.922422
fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable ' ' pension plan for city employes .	32.613487
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department , the fulton tax commissioner ' s office , the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms , grady hospital and the fulton health department .	25.607893
mayor william b . hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , pearl williams hartsfield , in fulton superior court friday .	23.677784
the couple was married aug . 2 , 1913 .	4.532844
they have a son , william berry jr . , and a daughter , mrs . j . m . cheshire of griffin .	7.8364944
attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon .	117.456604
the petition listed the mayor ' s occupation as `` attorney ' ' and his age as 71 .	43.74302
it listed his wife ' s age as 74 and place of birth as opelika , ala . .	61.221863
the petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year .	46.789967
the hartsfield home is at 637 e . pelham rd . aj .	9.239585
henry l . bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor ' s attorney .	13.569667
hartsfield has been mayor of atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 .	58.774445
his political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 .	118.672844
the mayor ' s present term of office expires jan . 1 .	10.541175
he will be succeeded by ivan allen jr . , who became a candidate in the sept . 13 primary after mayor hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection .	22.766169
georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor ' s race , a top official said wednesday .	48.516415
robert snodgrass , state gop chairman , said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience .	71.34631
state party chairman james w . dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept . 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen . john tower will be the featured speaker .	36.021355
in the blue ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters .	56.829918
despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to republicans who attended .	39.569614
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents .	64.1458
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken 1	140.72067
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2	87.92463
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform .	78.149635
sam caldwell , state highway department public relations director , resigned tuesday to work for lt . gov . garland byrd ' s campaign .	17.044928
caldwell ' s resignation had been expected for some time .	33.636135
he will be succeeded by rob ledford of gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .	27.310343
when the gubernatorial campaign starts , caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for byrd .	88.83833
the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly .	116.70448
before adjournment monday afternoon , the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made .	26.926477
gov . vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment .	133.89598
vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item .	78.787025
meanwhile , it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds .	53.62248
the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgia ' s most heavily traveled highways .	57.42892
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work .	37.016823
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities .	52.215416
vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov . marvin griffin .	31.045227
the highway department source told the constitution , however , that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds .	65.22666
schley county rep . b . d . pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the body ' s action of friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances .	47.889244
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie ' ' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .	53.519768
while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 87-31 .	60.5856
a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 29-5 .	10.144225
as of sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action .	59.305645
pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions .	52.244045
a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past .	122.59924
rep . mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended ' ' as state funds .	75.180756
barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed ' ' .	48.653122
but he added that none of georgia ' s congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution .	39.314266
the resolution , which barber tossed into the house hopper friday , will be formally read monday .	70.489655
it says that `` in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds ' ' , the state board of education should be directed to `` give priority ' ' to teacher pay raises .	38.21489
-- after a long , hot controversy , miller county has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election i ever saw in this county ' ' .	42.086437
the new school superintendent is harry davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated felix bush , a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee .	30.358646
davis received 1 , 119 votes in saturday ' s election , and bush got 402 .	39.417854
ordinary carey williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order .	56.176346
`` this was the coolest , calmest election i ever saw ' ' , colquitt policeman tom williams said .	10.211734
`` being at the polls was just like being at church .	142.83531
i didn ' t smell a drop of liquor , and we didn ' t have a bit of trouble ' ' .	11.474964
the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however .	143.37952
it was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence .	10.099457
the former county school superintendent , george p . callan , shot himself to death march 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board .	35.24709
during the election campaign , both candidates , davis and bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls .	36.450073
ordinary williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election .	208.15045
many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .	85.7765
sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise .	73.723495
`` everything went real smooth ' ' , the sheriff said .	9.820699
`` there wasn ' t a bit of trouble ' ' .	8.352929
-- committee approval of gov . price daniel ' s `` abandoned property ' ' act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers .	68.63553
daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures , in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation .	56.277668
under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .	33.899986
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it .	87.127396
daniel termed `` extremely conservative ' ' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug . 31 .	29.427864
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since texas was a republic ' ' .	37.87909
it permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .	120.56605
the bill , which daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer .	49.497253
the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , daniel declared .	51.71425
dewey lawrence , a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .	33.0299
`` if you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy ' ' , he said .	14.360508
`` you take out of circulation many millions of dollars ' ' .	8.599254
rep . charles e . hughes of sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies ' ' .	33.6364
his contention was denied by several bankers , including scott hudson of sherman , gaynor b . jones of houston , j . b . brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin .	24.424639
cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional ' ' since , he said , it would impair contracts .	26.578922
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last monday .	60.01036
-- senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen . george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties .	45.884182
the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state .	40.80819
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house .	41.73138
it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300 , 000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here .	69.73792
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas , harris , bexar , tarrant and el paso would be $451 , 500 , which would be a savings of $157 , 460 yearly after the first year ' s capital outlay of $88 , 000 was absorbed , parkhouse told the senate .	21.49659
the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county , saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school .	34.453915
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps . v . e . ( red ) berry and joe ratcliff .	30.984385
while details are still to be worked out , ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berry ' s proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected .	39.77069
`` we ' re getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting ' ' , said ratcliff .	31.64345
`` but i believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also .	59.837944
i ' m willing to stake my political career on it ' ' .	17.558424
rep . berry , an ex-gambler from san antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies .	21.579521
a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later .	50.509426
the house passed finally , and sent to the senate , a bill extending the state health department ' s authority to give planning assistance to cities .	66.58321
the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar .	120.820656
another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district .	7.5656896
the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted .	46.43719
without dissent , senators passed a bill by sen . a . r . schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district .	25.189724
money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site .	60.517174
one , by sen . louis crump of san saba , would aid more than 17 , 000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized .	23.70689
instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1 , 000 fine .	48.17493
it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league .	65.49895
the other bill , by sen . a . m . aikin jr . of paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds .	29.173506
natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by sen . frank owen 3 , of el paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas .	26.986195
marshall formby of plainview , former chairman of the texas highway commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections .	40.396065
under formby ' s plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the house , attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court .	29.614708
-- state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay .	44.92795
an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot , when texas votes on a u . s . senator .	42.760643
rep . wesley roberts of seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill .	60.39353
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb . 22 .	58.46114
the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot , roberts said .	23.119308
opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn ' t give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .	58.630566
all dallas members voted with roberts , except rep . bill jones , who was absent .	21.407232
-- paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas ' big cities thursday .	203.4519
rep . james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise , a wise county hamlet of 250 people .	87.116554
when the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen . george parkhouse of dallas .	31.551926
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen . parkhouse .	38.983135
the bill would increase from $5 , 000 , 000 to $15 , 000 , 000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .	42.85802
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas .	104.34913
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway cotten ' s attack .	68.60827
the bill ' s defenders were mostly small-town legislators like j . w . buchanan of dumas , eligio ( kika ) de la garza of mission , sam f . collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs .	19.330023
`` this is a poor boy ' s bill ' ' , said chapman .	30.037067
`` dallas and fort worth can vote bonds .	26.706879
this would help the little peanut districts ' ' .	1.1450061
-- a houston teacher , now serving in the legislature , proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods ' ' .	158.56892
rep . henry c . grover , who teaches history in the houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods ' ' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate .	60.322647
a normal year ' s work in college is 30 semester hours .	78.16272
grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching .	114.3173
the remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects .	54.107136
`` a person with a master ' s degree in physics , chemistry , math or english , yet who has not taken education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools ' ' , said grover .	39.575825
college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses .	35.484146
fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined grover as co-signers of the proposal .	22.325106
-- the board of regents of paris junior college has named dr . clarence charles clark of hays , kan . as the school ' s new president .	24.439354

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon ' ' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program .	73.47387
the report , culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load .	120.00327
the report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and adc dependency ' ' .	15.200277
the monthly cost of adc to more than 100 , 000 recipients in the county is 4 . 4 million dollars , said c . virgil martin , president of carson pirie scott & co . , committee chairman .	23.339323
`` we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence ' ' , martin said .	57.55508
the volume of adc cases will decrease , martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .	108.69016
these , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc ' ' .	53.12351
extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .	71.24681

several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , judge james b . parsons was told in criminal court yesterday .	26.067131
the disclosure by charles bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .	43.58254
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client , alan clements , 30 , a separate trial .	44.258327
bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom .	11.513314
`` the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client ' ' , bellows told the court .	19.21089
`` some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .	123.79871
it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others ' ' .	33.305054
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ' ' ? ?	39.98471
`` yes , your honor ' ' , replied bellows .	19.94539
`` what this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case .	26.346172
there is a conflict among the defendants ' ' .	2.5421226
-- president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio .	92.70932
the president spent much of the week-end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone .	41.782272
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port , mass . , a white house spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go ' ' toward completion .	49.175385
asked to elaborate , pierre salinger , white house press secretary , replied , `` i would say it ' s got to go thru several more drafts ' ' .	39.173714
salinger said the work president kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russia ' s demands and proposals for the city .	45.540436
the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov . 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m . karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means ' ' .	38.854614
karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence ' ' of the 50 persons .	60.57893
he said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens ' ' .	9.740636
karns ' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases .	155.9406
in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case ' ' .	21.910917
contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j . wexler , special prosecutor .	28.184704
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury .	43.256474
mayer goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation .	6.691268
wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning .	23.313671
karns said it was a `` wrongful act ' ' for wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room ' ' .	54.957455
he said this constituted a `` very serious misuse ' ' of the criminal court processes .	14.777982
`` actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court ' ' , said karns , who is a city judge in east st . louis sitting in cook county court .	48.358063
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .	52.09498
wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary ' ' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .	49.057552
the cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .	4.87376
the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns .	18.168428
after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them .	74.00855
-- president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14 . 2 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .	56.816967
the president , in a special message to congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .	67.03079
the aged care plan , similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on capitol hill .	35.930325
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .	63.809883
the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4 , 800 of pay per year .	52.831154
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5 , 000 a year and the payroll tax to 6 . 5 per cent -- 3 . 25 per cent each .	18.86192
similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .	62.97446
the payroll tax would actually rise to 7 . 5 per cent starting jan . 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .	41.911476
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1 . 5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .	97.08448
both figures would go higher in later years .	3.2422178
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .	20.333994
these would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .	62.539593
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1	80.11907
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .	32.62998
full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .	100.050705
a patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula ' ' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit .	52.918163
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient .	56.647648
community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .	50.83839
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .	36.572098
he said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay ' ' .	63.96513
`` this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs ' ' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals .	25.48828
`` this is not a program of socialized medicine .	32.515213
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .	139.88387
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital ' ' .	60.55724
they would still be paid by the patient .	4.7692366
apart from the aged care plan the president ' s most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .	20.053793
the president said the nation ' s 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .	65.54475
moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can ' t afford the schooling costs .	22.404306
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1 , 500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .	34.776657
the schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2 , 000 a year per student .	86.59918
in addition , the government would pay a $1 , 000 `` cost of education ' ' grant to the schools for each $1 , 500 in scholarship grants .	29.012459
officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5 . 1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .	44.05053
the president recommended federal `` matching grants ' ' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones .	20.437569
in the area of `` community health services ' ' , the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .	26.38906
he asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial ' ' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants ' ' to states to improve nursing homes .	22.638912
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .	29.814192
in the child health field , the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children ' s bureau .	47.51272
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .	68.532875
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .	46.47888
for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .	59.6584
the president said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine .	28.890278
the president said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them ' ' .	46.311832
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .	203.1479
legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the president ' s plan .	23.640673
those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .	80.82126
senate republican leader dirksen ( ill . ) and house republican leader charles halleck ( ind . ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .	51.65298
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .	47.858932
house speaker sam rayburn ( d . , tex . ) called the kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing ' ' , but made no prediction on its fate in the house .	49.032963
-- acting hastily under white house pressure , the senate tonight confirmed robert c . weaver as the nation ' s federal housing chief .	34.00618
only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .	79.82121
a number of scattered `` ayes ' ' and `` noes ' ' was heard .	14.8185
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .	73.699036
in the last eight years , all presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .	66.91362
the rule was enforced by demand of sen . wayne morse ( d . , ore . ) in connection with president eisenhower ' s cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedy ' s in 1961 .	19.847416
the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .	48.258507
this has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .	132.46346
in oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another ' s problems .	46.02848
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist ' ' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .	50.58038
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence .	51.147938
in the case of portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .	81.85603
the general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .	40.72961
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members ' votes , since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance .	53.864193
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive .	29.290789
even norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the nato line .	42.57928
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .	88.14649
one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk ' s speeches as `` inconclusive ' ' .	9.848009
but he hastened to add that , if united states policies were not always clear , despite mr . rusk ' s analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .	50.305683
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited .	41.568855
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite mr . rusk ' s personal popularity , that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .	63.761368
the secretary of state himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .	63.84528
but where the core of nato is concerned , the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states ' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone ' ' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato ' s disposal in european waters .	30.820175
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .	39.009132
the secretary ' s greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that east-west friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .	70.28542
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .	31.801886
this increase in the `` threshold ' ' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance ' s most difficult problems in the months to come .	58.4864
each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .	189.0903
the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time .	50.139908
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos .	55.67386
the united states , state department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam .	59.19405
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this .	32.686234
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated .	36.87978
but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .	27.559877
the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference .	21.806227
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .	24.236546
it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .	141.37332
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .	84.94396
but with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises	36.242027
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression ? ?	69.485985
former vice-president richard m . nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union .	24.019882
he was critical of what he feels is president kennedy ' s tendency to be too conciliatory .	27.348467
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it .	94.78253
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders ' ' in cuba .	30.189585
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn ' t attack the kennedy administration on this score .	56.05978
his reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .	46.54722
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .	479.95264
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b . morton ( r ) of kentucky , chairman of the republican national committee , that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination .	27.661596
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 harvard , boston university , brandeis , and massachusetts institute of technology educators .	54.849827
this group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups ' ' .	40.831493
it recommends that the united states `` seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations	36.8741
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds ' ' .	30.828745
mr . nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation .	129.48425
but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated .	76.73067
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos , almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by mr . nixon and the professors .	47.406796
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration .	45.0447
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements .	351.07205
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .	68.377686
but thus far there has been no response in kind .	113.53341
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .	31.04923
in laos , the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture .	66.75673
again and again it asked the communists to `` freeze ' ' the military situation in laos .	19.652925
but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate .	66.57229
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service ' ' and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization .	51.769917
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos .	19.932232
but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos .	50.440384
there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , thailand and south viet nam .	63.232845
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos .	30.441563
the pro-western government , which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma `` neutralist ' ' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army .	57.466263
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the pro-western government to the hilt .	59.084126
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .	58.020603
one factor was the statement of senator j . w . fulbright ( d ) of arkansas , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee .	12.350964
he declared on march 25 that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal ' ' of prince souvanna .	23.411684
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states .	12.1434355
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation ' ' .	21.029963
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the president ' s committee on juvenile delinquency and crime , to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .	43.682247
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend .	45.63945
the president has also called upon the attorney general , the secretary of health , education and welfare , and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .	26.371365
simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l . hackett , a special assistant to the attorney general , as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime .	19.022669
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders .	33.61813
among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age .	53.884487
east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , raymond h . hawksley , the present city cd head , believes .	42.300762
mr . hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally ' ' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .	40.156338
east providence now has no civil defense program .	3.6737998
mr . hawksley , the state ' s general treasurer , has been a part-time cd director in the city for the last nine years .	21.255674
he is not interested in being named a full-time director .	17.62241
noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nation ' s civil defense program , mr . hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .	27.987375
he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about $3 , 500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs .	37.40232
mr . hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time cd job .	29.780596
one of these men is former fire chief john a . laughlin , he said .	20.971687
along with a director , the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .	52.86584
one advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .	42.79653
matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said .	24.482288
mr . hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station .	100.15103
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area .	38.027096
speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , mr . hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .	33.3932
the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in seekonk would be another .	35.206474
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point .	123.88203
mr . hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .	118.481224
such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .	76.0867
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time cd director , mr . hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .	36.95756
one of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .	72.55003
other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government .	23.461252
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .	179.10677
governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly .	48.180225
the governor ' s move into the so-called `` blue law ' ' controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r . grant , deputy city clerk of central falls .	39.568253
mr . notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july 10 and sent to the state house by miss grant .	56.19837
the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .	38.708916
while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review , mr . notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty . gen . j . joseph nugent to get `` the benefit of his views ' ' .	30.917145
he will then appoint the study committee with mr . nugent ' s cooperation , the governor said .	37.168625
`` i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings ' ' , mr . notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws ' ' .	28.708273
the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales ' ' .	42.82002
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .	33.34351
should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .	50.633743
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws .	225.13159
the statutes , similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath .	37.01655
the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday .	86.1038
the only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday ' ' , the council ' s resolution said .	29.91853
the small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community ' ' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors ' ' .	35.754482
it declares that sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue ' ' to the local government .	22.405956
the council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business ' ' on sunday .	30.538515
they `` operate on a volume basis ' ' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community ' ' .	27.674955
liberals and conservatives in both parties -- democratic and republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , george h . reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .	61.433144
mr . reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheraton-biltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare ' ' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .	35.657265
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .	76.68528
he said he was `` confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in 1910 ' ' .	11.263101
that , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade .	22.555527
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party .	37.186756
the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track .	25.866346
he steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track ' ' .	23.768839
he said that when he was a socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources .	33.1466
he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .	90.43958
mr . reama , who retired as vice president of the american screw co . in 1955 said , `` both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it ' ' .	59.978836
he said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze ' ' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .	73.33865
indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , mr . reama said `` a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own ' ' .	55.456944
mr . reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .	39.262897
a petition bearing the signatures of more than 1 , 700 johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .	34.07828
william a . martinelli , chairman of the citizens group of johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr . .	39.140553
the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and mr . martinelli happens to hold that post .	34.171757
mr . martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .	69.1847
he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work .	41.84788
a difference of opinion arose between mr . martinelli and john p . bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .	30.197884
mr . martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while mr . bourcier said that a special election might be called instead .	53.593662
mr . bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .	66.45526
he assured mr . martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .	56.60517
mr . martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .	104.087135
he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .	56.977825
`` after inspiring this , i think we should certainly follow through on it ' ' , he declared .	34.613194
`` it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement ' ' .	23.67648
he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission .	56.4515
`` our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement ' ' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town ' ' .	35.915054
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september .	45.57375
some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town ' s insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .	79.64162
increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .	57.84946
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses ' ' .	37.27766
several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system .	51.401527
action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at monday ' s special north providence town council meeting .	55.935196
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a . abatuno to draft the ordinance .	61.553715
at the last session of the general assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .	67.091484
nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .	41.96626
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition .	179.50484
local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .	54.371395
-- james p . mitchell and sen . walter h . jones r-bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j . hughes , democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the gop is `` campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism ' ' .	24.234592
mitchell was for using it , jones against , and sen . wayne dumont jr . r-warren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the park hotel .	27.760956
the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club .	41.52116
it was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of women ' s clubs .	47.680943
hughes said monday , `` it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired .	37.036873
now he ' s gone , the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state ' ' .	19.6974
sunday he had added , `` we can love eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership ' ' .	107.473175
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .	32.299812
`` how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ' ' ? ?	48.411255
the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy ' ' while working in his adminstration .	58.595547
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall ' s presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue .	60.116188
jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .	234.36531
`` he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign ' ' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign ' ' .	39.27413
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes ' remark .	35.177578
dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary .	323.77655
he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .	17.411646
state aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority , and making new jersey attractive to new industry .	52.527515
mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republican-controlled state senate `` must share the blame for this ' ' .	31.834217
noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co . plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .	58.80909
`` but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time ' ' , mitchell said .	23.714087
jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for mitchell .	131.83904
he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises .	75.71301
`` he calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can ' t have it both ways ' ' , jones said .	26.805616
the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue ' ' .	46.565754
`` i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j . hughes .	49.794365
his reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president ' s leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations .	34.234695
`` i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .	226.70654
`` such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .	62.962452
it can only rebound to mr . hughes ' discredit ' ' .	8.923813
sen . charles w . sandman , r-cape may , said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .	76.40518
sandman , state campaign chairman for jones , was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel , newark , of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones .	61.3131
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican party ' s nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .	78.933
sandman said `` the announcement that sen . clifford case aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr . mitchell is a dead giveaway .	68.545815
it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jersey ' s problems .	65.38208
`` we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr . mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington .	54.149
`` we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr . mitchell some of the glow of sen . case ' s candidacy of last year .	34.31257
that , too , will fail ' ' .	1.8107773
sandman announced the appointment of mrs . harriet copeland greenfield of 330 woodland ave . , westfield , as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee .	20.203356
mrs . greenfield is president of the westfield women ' s republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman .	55.13245
county supervisor weldon r . sheets , who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them .	47.93548
the proposal , sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a `` lip service word ' ' .	90.483536
sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .	57.901894
sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january , 1964 .	23.95454
although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines .	87.90728
the candidacy of mayor james j . sheeran of west orange , for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county , was supported today by edward w . roos , west orange public safety commissioner .	33.8168
sheeran , a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organization ' s candidate , freeholder william macdonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy , now a member of the state board of tax appeals .	31.818554
`` my experience as public safety commissioner ' ' , roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer .	68.895096
-- william j . seidel , state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development , has retired after 36 years of service .	43.59862
a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a . bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state .	13.470212
seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies .	27.768051
in october 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section .	23.927965
under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting .	78.41138
he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station .	75.52742
he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens .	50.226055
he is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the red cross and state department of education .	39.06269
-- richard j . hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state ' ' .	36.86508
he promised nearly 200 democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn `` when i come back here after the november election you ' ll think , ' you ' re my man -- you ' re the kind of governor we ' re glad we elected ' ' ' .	39.02956
he said , `` we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time ' ' .	34.414425
in his only attack on the republicans , hughes said , `` the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .	41.94134
but we ' ll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform .	185.59476
we ' ll not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson .	83.439186
`` we ' ll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november ' ' .	65.98201
he said , `` you can see signs of the republicans ' feeble attack on the meyner administration .	48.83784
but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead ' ' .	37.121235
he urged new jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy ' ' .	29.189266
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .	33.840874
`` we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean ' ' , the former superior court judge said .	21.450607
`` to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early 1940s ' ' .	33.501762
calling the democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people ' ' , hughes asked , `` a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november ' ' .	24.56477
hughes supported gov . meyner ' s `` green acres ' ' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development .	42.78228
he said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday .	16.721973
the plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state .	77.288055
the other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis .	7.7576027
hughes said , `` this is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it ' ' , pointing out the state population has increased 125 , 000 each year since 1950 .	36.82045
he said `` morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve ' ' .	50.825317
hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved .	27.787344
he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans .	24.83659
`` after the primary ' ' , he promised , `` i ' ll be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration .	73.82273
i ' m not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee ' ' .	13.293142
-- fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .	82.94523
the outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the april 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by .	69.85844
there may be other 1961 state committee retirements come april 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters .	111.48182
a special presentation was made to mrs . geraldine thompson of red bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .	57.180622
she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women ' s suffrage amendment .	33.684826
she served one four-year term on the national committee .	5.692874
resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r . screvane and abraham d . beame as running mates .	39.40551
at the same time reaction among anti-organization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayor ' s reported plan was generally favorable .	26.92931
some anti-organization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .	38.76504
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayor ' s efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .	69.801506
some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr . wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .	31.487637
some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr . wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept . 7 democratic primary .	38.852146
these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr . wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city .	21.477413
their view is that last-minute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor .	51.661316
in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , mr . wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a . buckley , the bronx democratic leader , and with joseph t . sharkey , the brooklyn democratic leader .	27.519003
as usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g . de sapio , the manhattan leader .	25.882238
he is publicly on record as believing mr . de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party .	43.34663
last night the mayor visited mr . buckley at the bronx leader ' s home for a discussion of the situation .	27.089287
apparently he believes mr . buckley holds the key to the democratic organization ' s acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .	45.7204
in talks with mr . buckley last week in washington , the mayor apparently received the bronx leader ' s assent to dropping controller lawrence e . gerosa , who lives in the bronx , from this year ' s ticket .	19.916979
but mr . buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr . gerosa ' s successor .	25.307367
the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr . screvane , who lives in queens , to replace abe stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for president of the city council and mr . beame , who lives in brooklyn , to replace mr . gerosa as the candidate for controller .	24.850805
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx .	34.68472
after his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday ' s new york times .	41.09044
`` it didn ' t come from me .	6.961577
but as i have said before , if i announce my candidacy , i will have something definite to say about running mates ' ' .	23.228502
-- a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts .	154.12053
there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics .	50.88036
the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same ' ' .	41.407486
`` it ' s ' see joe , see jim ' ' ' , he says .	18.322075
a political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters ' ' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control .	63.39219
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them ' ' .	30.989483
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin o ' connor ' s novel , `` the last hurrah ' ' .	19.34837
but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .	15.020833
a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .	34.59913
graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations .	133.64435
and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state .	90.69299
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in massachusetts public life .	38.92853
day after day some new episode is reported .	4.0710554
the state public works department is accused of having spent $8 , 555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property .	86.9963

-- congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .	14.176911
in the senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .	77.06402
in the house , the southern-republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administration ' s housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill .	42.370853
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee .	76.41541
it is expected to be reported out tuesday , but this is a little uncertain .	22.257025
the panel ' s action depends on the return of representative james w . trimble , democrat of arkansas , who has been siding with speaker sam rayburn ' s forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor .	26.616919
mr . trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday .	210.62395
the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans .	14.618522
the democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week .	40.372486
the $6 , 100 , 000 , 000 measure , which was passed last monday by the senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families .	37.166973
it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .	105.760155
the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee , where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy .	66.03797
they are james j . delaney of queens and thomas p . o ' neill jr . of massachusetts .	30.319513
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of 1958 .	32.070145
this would provide for long-term federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics .	40.496365
mr . delaney and mr . o ' neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee .	50.314114
about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps .	42.075203
in the $40 , 000 , 000 budget that has been submitted for congressional approval , $26 , 000 , 000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .	26.957838
twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , gordon boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a washington interview .	23.075958
six of these were proposed by religious groups .	4.079702
they will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in southeast asia , africa , the middle east and latin america .	32.54462
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals .	80.86158
there are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example	32.44291
last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .	67.46574
the u . s . government is paying for it .	31.676949
the u . s . government pays for all its overseas workers ' ' .	15.734403
`` i don ' t work for the government ' ' , the american said .	38.012722
`` same thing ' ' , he said .	4.6856823
and then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem	58.48403
can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ?	48.874043
r . sargent shriver jr . , director of the corps , is certain that they can .	34.43905
no religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes .	32.242046
-- at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia , premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming `` look , he took everything i had ' ' ! !	28.697073

indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of asia , africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid .	39.642323
the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations .	19.308672
the communist countries allocated more than $1 , 000 , 000 , 000 in economic aid alone last year , according to western estimates .	27.385305
this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .	33.153297
in 1960 more than 6 , 000 communist technicians were present in those countries .	30.78863

-- a committee of experts has recommended that a country ' s population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations .	35.515694
this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations .	41.52226
one effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india .	76.86705
india is the most populous united nations member with more than 400 , 000 , 000 inhabitants .	16.921305

the three laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days .	79.788185
the princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .	136.20248
the meetings in zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition government .	107.209526
appointment of william s . pfaff jr . , 41 , as promotion manager of the times-picayune publishing company was announced saturday by john f . tims , president of the company .	18.998396

-- thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan . 20 .	24.07498
assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f . kennedy and retiring president dwight d . eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route .	42.069374
pennsylvania avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint .	37.32045
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .	4.982234
within view of the avenue are some of the united states government ' s tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .	25.945944
of course , 1600 pennsylvania , the white house , is the most famous address of the free world .	23.18174
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high .	98.99623
great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old .	22.972479
in the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .	48.36524
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote .	20.578241
in the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .	56.547035
along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in 1865 is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country ' s most valuable records are kept .	47.812172
also the department of justice building is located where j . edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation .	11.67371
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground .	73.66246
many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square , opposite the white house .	12.844389
in this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen . andrew jackson , hero of the battle of new orleans .	58.75404
moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least 40 marching units .	32.64115
about 16 , 000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .	27.857347
division one of the parade will be the service academies .	56.883247
division two will include the representations of massachusetts and texas , the respective states of the president and of vice-president l . b . johnson .	29.373793
then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .	65.111435
division three will be headed by the marines followed by 12 states	82.72183
division four will be headed by the navy , followed by 11 states	42.071896
division five , by the air force followed by 11 states .	25.16414
division six will be headed by the coast guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , puerto rico , the virgin islands , guam , american samoa , the trust territories and the canal zone .	21.197292
-- what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi ? ?	245.60735
even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state ' s immediate political future .	82.73784
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- gov . ross barnett .	33.11561
barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .	118.93967
consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year .	142.90167
some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .	149.6737
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor ' s office .	48.34595
there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble .	52.629593
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon ' ' he had in the 1960 legislative session .	42.42288
if barnett doesn ' t call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session .	36.08991
the odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .	46.86442
legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22 . 50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating .	39.911777
barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure .	32.19516
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state ' s congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .	84.28622
with eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic delta district , and congressman frank e . smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature .	72.06379
mississippi ' s relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house .	40.007267
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck .	21.01892
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .	62.497528
barnett , as the titular head of the democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary .	40.287243
with a democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election .	76.678696
now , the picture is clouded , and even us sens . james o . eastland and john c . stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .	21.855236
reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .	41.60074
-- the gov . jimmie h . davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor ' s theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .	67.30665
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .	61.311375
but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government .	54.300156
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .	37.150593
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .	90.639946
but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .	67.66255
indeed , the administration ' s curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .	30.72235
the administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program .	13.130248
the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote .	41.610043
the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes .	26.737581
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy .	43.24549
if it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .	42.890007
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature .	3.7978938
actually , davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .	39.729317
many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration .	63.99286
this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly .	80.72073
they would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual .	39.16967
passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition .	98.73996
he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .	69.64703
then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .	114.23191
it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .	87.92506
but if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .	49.054943
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash .	39.530357
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .	280.83713
if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma .	37.84373
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues .	57.36201
in either case , it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser .	35.306072
the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .	249.43916
it is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .	25.686325
but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature .	47.33674
this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year .	31.224182
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize .	50.578896
any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves .	61.261692
the new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .	39.552193
city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track ' ' with the city .	30.560394
estimates of the city ' s loss in the $344 , 000 job have ranged as high as $200 , 000 .	38.623386
hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co . contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate ' ' bids of competing contractors .	32.22182
the hughes concern then took `` shortcuts ' ' on the project but got paid anyway , hemphill said .	27.51241
the controller ' s charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures tuesday	82.71839
the city has sued for the full amount of the $172 , 400 performance bond covering the contract .	67.456055
the philadelphia transportation co . is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project .	124.80745
the signature of harold v . varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project .	31.22013
varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor .	8.37489
managing director donald c . wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter .	34.282692
the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959 .	47.997356
the hughes company and the consolidated industries , inc . , both of 3646 n . 2d st . , filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law .	34.093864
on monday , the hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization .	67.0368
business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by hemphill and district attorney james c . crumlish , jr . .	26.934221
the suit was filed later in the day in common pleas court 7 against the hughes company and two bonding firms .	102.10131
travelers indemnity co . and the continental casualty co . .	8.880525
at berger ' s direction , the city also intervened in the hughes bankruptcy case in u . s . district court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there .	43.40189
`` i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated ' ' , berger said .	26.601027
the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track .	193.79869
the contract called for overhauling of 102 joints .	5.934802
the city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , hemphill charged .	144.03963
hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint .	35.470192
the bid from a . belanger and sons of cambridge , mass . , which listed the same officers as hughes , was $600 per joint .	75.49069
but , hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint .	9.295738
berger ' s decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference .	40.377163
wagner said the city paid only $37 , 500 to the hughes company .	8.070647
`` we won ' t know the full amount until we get a full report ' ' , wagner said .	68.23334
`` we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond ' ' , berger said .	12.736641
wagner replied , `` can ' t you just see the headline ' city hooked for $172 , 000 ' ' ' ? ?	34.85425
berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount ' ' .	43.378532
douglas m . pratt , president of the ptc , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el .	48.18928
`` we want to find out who knew about it ' ' , pratt said .	6.7708654
`` certain people must have known about it ' ' .	1.8278449
`` the ptc is investigating the whole matter ' ' , pratt said .	5.4167004
samuel d . goodis , representing the philadelphia hotel association , objected on tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year .	43.182186
goodis voiced his objection before city council ' s finance committee .	7.457819
for hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , goodis said .	30.602493
his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services .	44.083576
the new fees are expected to raise an additional $740 , 000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2 , 330 , 000 more a year after that .	25.919296
the ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room .	28.064478
the cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 .	26.146654
goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels .	14.452208
the city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457 , 000 a year .	31.687859
the increase also was opposed by leonard kaplan , spokesman for the home builders association of philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses .	91.571526
a proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from councilwoman virginia knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs .	13.259606
the ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog .	103.29796
mrs . knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city ' s services to animal care .	55.701717
in reply , deputy police commissioner howard r . leary said that the city spends more than $115 , 000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43 , 000 in fees .	20.382153
he reported that the city ' s contributions for animal care included $67 , 000 to the women ' s s . p . c . a .	25.616966
$15 , 000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15 , 000 to investigate dog bites .	30.636536
city finance director richard j . mcconnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year .	55.247955
the city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said .	49.357174
the new fee schedule also was supported by commissioner of licenses and inspections barnet lieberman and health commissioner eugene a . gillis .	9.905048
petitions asking for a jail term for norristown attorney julian w . barnard will be presented to the montgomery county court friday , it was disclosed tuesday by horace a . davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last nov . 1 by barnard ' s hit-run car .	26.267271
the petitions will be presented in open court to president judge william f . dannehower , davenport said .	21.52122
barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by judge warren k . hess , and placed on two years ' probation providing he does not drive during that time .	52.82638
he was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning .	155.51541
victim of the accident was robert lee stansbery , 39 .	13.875157
his widow started the circulation of petitions after barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation .	5.2799335
the city planning commission on tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the redevelopment authority for the purchase of land in the $300 , 000 , 000 eastwick redevelopment area project .	21.83538
the commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project .	21.96277
one of the agreements calls for the new eastwick corp . to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12 , 192 , 865 .	13.447642
the tract is bounded by island ave . , dicks ave . , 61st st . , and eastwick ave . .	6.90483
it is designated as stage 1 residential on the redevelopment authority ' s master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores .	55.15643
the corporation was formed by the reynolds metal co . and the samuel a . and henry a . berger firm , a philadelphia builder , for work in the project .	41.518368
the second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of stage 1 residential to philadelphia builders eastwick corp . , a firm composed of 10 philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project .	62.78365
the plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by dr . constantinos a . doxiadis , former minister of reconstruction in greece and a consulting planner for the new eastwick corp . .	15.891756
the plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic .	28.573254
it provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project .	25.410107
the esplanade eliminates grovers ave . , which on original plans ran through the center of the development .	60.251152
the esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project .	14.305541
kansas city , mo . , feb . 9 ( upi )	6.462287
-- the president of the kansas city local of the international association of fire fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work .	38.865368
battalion chief stanton m . gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles .	38.63473
the battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work .	98.70376
`` i ' d just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and i was lying on the driveway ' ' , he said .	13.535613
gladden ' s wife and two of his sons , john , 17 , and jim , 13 , were inside the house .	37.341446
the younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall .	31.185562
the explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house .	13.898722
the left front wheel landed 100 feet away .	2.9239764
police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either tnt or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel .	56.701534
it was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car ' s starter .	10.478739
gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night .	53.447857
the fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union .	41.141266
gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union ' s battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 .	56.212894
the fire fighters association here offered a $5 , 000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing .	37.150196
a $500 reward was offered by the association ' s local in kansas city , kas . .	10.9444895
the association said it would post 24 hour guards at gladden ' s home and at those of james mining and eugene shiflett .	38.360863
mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and shiflett is a member of its executive committee .	51.497135
ankara , turkey , oct . 24 ( ap )	2.6779904
-- turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with gen . cemal gursel as president .	95.002625
an agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on oct . 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d ' etat .	31.161457
by-passing the military junta which has ruled turkey since the overthrow of premier adnan menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by gen . cedvet sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government .	31.135607
the army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen . gursel as president .	115.99241
gen . gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months .	27.678675
the military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned .	34.776814
party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own .	117.75089
vincent g . ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced monday by charles e . raymond , district attorney .	26.663935
ierulli will replace desmond d . connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by march 31 .	89.482994
ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in portland since november , 1959 .	15.127057
he is a graduate of portland university and the northwestern college of law .	44.503323
he is married and the father of three children .	7.710375
helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , e . m . martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night .	43.11051
martin , who has been in office in washington , d . c . , for 13 months spoke at the council ' s annual meeting at the multnomah hotel .	15.719248
he told some 350 persons that the united states ' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths .	62.51464
`` we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours ' ' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty .	69.00267
insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the soviet union .	15.943904
he cited east germany where after 15 years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up ' ' .	60.69045
martin called for patience on the part of americans .	72.93819
`` the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build ' ' , he said .	47.552612
by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said .	51.296036
`` we have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient ' ' , the assistant secretary said .	28.541458
economically , martin said , the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves .	108.47297
private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves .	51.560627

the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portland ' s civil defense more plans for the city ' s schools in event of attack .	78.14125
but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow .	104.34579
the board members , after hearing the coordination plea from mrs . ralph h . molvar , 1409 sw maplecrest dr . , said they thought they had already been cooperating .	37.75284
chairman c . richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go .	64.66225
dr . melvin w . barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful ' ' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district .	79.93762
`` los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster ' ' , he said .	23.880165
i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following .	79.14462
mrs . molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand ' ' , said , `` we must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn ' t be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children ' ' .	36.128918
dr . barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work ' ' .	48.84549
mrs . molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowe ' s program .	59.401676
the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting .	79.05975
it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done .	59.91669

a stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the assemblies of god , in session at the memorial coliseum .	40.197987
the council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination ' s 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 .	39.864788
the changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible .	97.75457
the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible .	52.242065
at the adoption , the rev . t . f . zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives ' ' .	29.268463
however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list .	150.20758
the first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads	62.49458
`` the scriptures , both old and new testament , are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct ' ' .	23.133049

talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12 , 000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the united states every 1-1/2 minutes , he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge ' ' .	49.799183
`` in 35 years we have opened 7 , 000 churches ' ' , the rev . mr . brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10 , 000 persons .	16.95558
`` in this light we need 1 , 000 churches in illinois , where we have 200	68.33229

to step up the denomination ' s program , the rev . mr . brandt suggested the vision of 8 , 000 new assemblies of god churches in the next 10 years .	20.216276

u . s . dist . judge charles l . powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys monday in portland ' s insurance fraud trial .	40.727993
denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict .	17.605797
in denying motions for dismissal , judge powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are ' ' .	71.17356
attorney dwight l . schwab , in behalf of defendant philip weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking weinstein to the conspiracy , but judge powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide .	18.65531
schwab also declared there is no proof of weinstein ' s entering a conspiracy to use the u . s . mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor a . lawrence burbank replied	17.130009
`` it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the u . s . mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out ' ' .	18.300495
in the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case .	56.316643
-- the orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen major-league clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the kansas city athletics by a score of 5 to 3 .	53.926437
indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage .	86.68718
over the first five frames , jack fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 american league pennant , held the a ' s scoreless while yielding three scattered hits .	76.788246
then dick hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock .	52.560875
a two-run homer by norm siebern and a solo blast by bill tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .	59.46796
with one down in the eighth , marv throneberry drew a walk and stole second as hyde fanned tuttle .	15.809451
catcher frank house ' s throw in an effort to nab throneberry was wide and in the dirt .	19.916338
then heywood sullivan , kansas city catcher , singled up the middle and throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .	43.99196
rookie southpaw george stepanovich relieved hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the a ' s fifth tally on a walk to second baseman dick howser , a wild pitch , and frank cipriani ' s single under shortstop jerry adair ' s glove into center .	30.800568
the orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three kansas city pitchers .	30.25677
three were doubles , brooks robinson getting a pair and marv breeding one .	10.066854
bill kunkel , bob hartman and ed keegan did the mound chores for the club down from west palm beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in miami stadium .	85.46857
the birds got five hits and all three of their runs off kunkel before hartman took over in the top of the fourth .	33.554707
hartman , purchased by the a ' s from the milwaukee braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph .	36.864994
keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the birds threatened but failed to tally .	60.15303
in the ninth , robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left .	55.7525
whitey herzog , performing in right as the orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked keegan for a base on balls .	26.856068
pete ward was sent in for house and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to howser on the grass back of short .	34.75084
john powell , batting for adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and buddy barker , up for stepanovich , bounced out sharply to jerry lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest .	29.085331
the orioles got a run in the first inning when breeding , along with robinson , the two birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on russ snyder ' s single to right and crossed on kunkel ' s wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate .	38.63305
the flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out .	185.41307
jackie brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally .	26.093353
jim gentile bounced a hard shot off kunkel ' s glove and beat it out for a single , and when lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman throneberry ' s head brandt took third and gentile second on the error .	44.73601
then robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners .	119.19647
when robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , tuttle to andy carey .	37.81393
the detailed rundown on the kansas city scoring in the sixth went like this	123.14701
lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face hyde and romped around as siebern blasted hyde ' s next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center .	17.76258
carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first .	239.40224
it was ruled a difficult chance and a hit .	149.50116
then throneberry rapped into a fast double play .	6.1268206
breeding to adair to gentile , setting up tuttle ' s 390-foot homer over the wall in left center .	32.53735
if the orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the american league champion new york yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test sunday afternoon .	44.74267
-- the flavor of baltimore ' s florida grapefruit league news ripened considerably late today when the orioles were advised that ron hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the army ' s military training program and is ready for belated spring training .	35.470165
hansen , who slugged the 1960 oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a	29.658487
freshman average , completes the birds ' spring squad at 49 players .	14.482109
the big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 american league `` rookie-of-the-year ' ' , flew here late this afternoon from baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15 , 000 and was a spectator at tonight ' s 5-to-3 loss to kansas city -- the winless birds ' sixth setback in a row .	27.653399
the 6-foot 3-inch hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring .	38.58061
he hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the flock breaks camp three weeks hence .	37.170998
when he was inducted into the army at fort knox , ky . , hansen ' s weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best ' ' he said .	33.106247
`` i feel good physically ' ' , hansen added , `` but i think i ' ll move better carrying a little less weight than i ' m carrying now ' ' .	31.220972
the rangy , albany ( cal . ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding ' ' as his 1961 goal .	33.610348
`` i think i can do a better job with the glove , now that i know the hitters around the league a little better ' ' , he said .	26.846327
hansen will engage in his first workout at miami stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the new york yankees .	23.124403
skinny brown and hoyt wilhelm , the flock ' s veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the american league champions in tomorrow ' s 8 p . m . contest .	23.076141
ryne duren and roland sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the yanks ' auburn ( n . y . ) farm club of the class-d new york-pennsylvania league , are the probable rival pitchers .	16.683943

pitcher steve barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the army ' s accelerated wintertime military course , also at fort knox , ky . .	25.322933
the 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did hansen .	563.3477
baltimore ' s bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as manager paul richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit .	59.333
`` take a ride on this one ' ' , brooks robinson greeted hansen as the bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight .	21.605522
it was the first of two doubles by robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate .	23.8403
just before game time , robinson ' s pretty wife , connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer .	57.547703
unfortunately , brooks ' s teammates were not in such festive mood as the orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three kansas city rookie hurlers .	24.454313
hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with lee macphail	116.77451
j . a . w . iglehart , chairman of the oriole board of directors , and public relations director jack dunn .	17.235132

kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in new york with a clocking of 1 . 09 . 3 , wiped out mills ' s early pace and beat the young big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards .	71.80351
both were under the meet mark of 1 . 10 . 8 set in 1950 by mal whitfield .	21.280363
mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race .	46.385063
then kerr , a graduate student from illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off mills ' s challenge on the final turn .	98.49821

-- two errors by new york yankee shortstop tony kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the chicago white sox today .	8.555383
-- a texas halfback who doesn ' t even know the team ' s plays , eldon moritz , ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games .	44.41813
time stands still every time moritz , a 26-year-old army signal corps veteran , goes into the field .	64.78174
although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every saturday , in fact -- out of football .	122.80649
moritz doesn ' t even have a nose guard or hip pads but he ' s one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl .	50.28683
that ' s because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries .	35.997875
he ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of washington state .	77.76097
moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team .	56.306683
but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and you ' ll get the quick response , `` place-kicker ' ' .	35.558624
a 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from stamford , moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .	195.16553
last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn ' t get into a single game .	61.661617
`` this year , coach royal told me if i ' d work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me ' ' , said moritz .	43.948147
`` so i started practicing on it in spring training .	79.62088
moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough .	44.558075
moritz said monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week .	49.977367
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school , including one that beat anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game .	42.74111
`` i kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school ' ' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time .	29.235092
i never did miss one in a playoff game -- i kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years ' ' .	41.678406
moritz came to texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury .	25.800161
he missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 .	38.640865
his statistical record that year , when texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards .	68.14951
he went into the army in march , 1957 , and returned two years later .	32.07208
but he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season .	231.34799
place kicking is largely a matter of timing , moritz declared .	23.038181
`` once you get the feel of it , there ' s not much to it .	33.17358
i ' ve tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can ' t seem to get the feel .	41.065445
practice helps you to get your timing down .	9.410302
`` it ' s kind of like golf -- if you don ' t swing a club very often , your timing gets off ' ' .	35.238148
moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session .	117.41253
`` if you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead ' ' , he explained .	14.183349
in their first three games , the longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent	61.59288
their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries .	22.268517
tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries	26.919365
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games .	55.172054
saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the washington state game , for four plays he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench .	38.62028
wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists he ' ll be ready for oklahoma .	74.814735
last week , when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conference ' s top four in rushing , he said `` that won ' t last long ' ' .	37.002583
monday , he had four longhorns in the top four .	66.80204
a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday , but attention quickly turned from saturday ' s victory to next week ' s problem rice university .	149.56526

`` we ' re just real happy for the players ' ' , coach bill meek said of the 9-7 victory over the air force academy .	24.43736
`` i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on .	152.96097
it was the first time we ' ve been ahead this season ( when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) ' ' .	55.840218
assistant coach john cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , i think , on the part of the coaches and the players .	18.11438
we needed it and we got it ' ' .	1.3017018
meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon .	118.6552
both turned in top jobs for the second straight game .	18.221773
`` nelson played magnificent football ' ' , meek praised .	33.177383
`` he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times .	22.806463
and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown .	37.15553
he broke that boy ( air force fullback nick arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football ' ' .	28.405928
gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages .	20.587526
one was on a fourth-down screen pass from the mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into gannon ' s territory .	47.41273
`` as soon as it started to form , gannon spotted it ' ' , meek said .	15.539184
`` he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback terry isaacson ) had time to turn around .	120.44537
he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss ' ' .	49.25063
the air force ' s , and the game ' s , final play , was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards .	46.288177
`` he just lay back there and waited for it ' ' , meek said .	6.630622
`` he almost brought it back all the way ' ' .	3.9351873
except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice , meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice .	30.145588
`` kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game ' ' , meek said .	8.42693
`` he ' ll be out of action all this week .	269.18103
he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .	58.643875
there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee ' ' .	4.673336
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland .	36.950294
`` he ' s looking a lot better , and he ' s able to run ' ' , meek explained .	19.379776
`` we ' ll let him do a lot of running this week , but i don ' t know if he ' ll be able to play ' ' .	13.401252
the game players saw the air force film monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes .	30.85151
`` we ' ll work hard tuesday , wednesday and thursday ' ' , meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage friday .	33.24978
we ' ll work out about an hour on saturday , then we ' ll work monday and tuesday of next week , then taper off ' ' .	39.65733
smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday , oct . 21 .	24.84904
-- held out of texas tech ' s sweat-suits drill monday at lubbock was tackle richard stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the raiders ' 38-7 loss to texas a & m because of its important game with arkansas coming up saturday , baylor worked out in the rain monday -- mud or no mud .	41.245007
end gene raesz , who broke a hand in the owl ' s game with lsu , was back working out with rice monday , and john nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week ' s idleness with an ankle injury .	30.886856
the texas aggies got a day off monday -- a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night , but myers announced that halfback george hargett , shaken up in the tech game , would not play against trinity saturday .	42.71642
halfback bud priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined tcu ' s workout monday .	13.405499
the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the denver broncos -- but their visit will be a short one .	61.52182
the texans have two more road games -- at buffalo and houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach hank stram ' s men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .	53.59279
buffalo coach buster ramsey , who has become one of the game ' s greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-national football leaguers , m . c . reynolds and warren rabb .	28.574345
rabb , the former louisiana state field general , came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the houston oilers , defending league champions .	40.479008
`` buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way ' ' .	64.88305
ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver , and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , jack spikes , though he did the team ' s place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .	37.735855
`` our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well ' ' , said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .	34.282444
`` in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job ' ' .	10.076742
the texans won the game through ball control , with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only 17 passes .	49.155197
`` we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack ' ' , explained stram .	49.73595
`` they can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble ' ' .	54.739883
the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans , but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .	62.147278
the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes , the flashy halfback .	11.393293
he was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards .	27.476028
the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denver ' s al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas .	29.88223
`` that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away ' ' , said stram , quipping , `` i think i ' ll put that play in the book ' ' .	19.767998
the early southwest conference football leaders -- texas , arkansas and texas a & m -- made a big dent in the statistics last week .	42.632553
texas ' 545-yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1 , 512 yards ( 1 , 065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new swc high .	19.541855
arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip tcu , and a & m , with a 38-point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 .	32.766647
completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the aggies had a total offense of 361 yards .	12.6381445
texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to baylor ' s 126 ) , but idle baylor has the best defensive record ( 187 . 5 yards per game to texas ' 189 ) .	19.498186
a & m has the best defense against passes , 34 . 7 yards per game .	58.9119
not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology .	51.1449
rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis , 5-3 .	28.121777
the husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the denver area .	37.878807
it was nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight .	24.656849
they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack .	36.431713
nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning .	20.051739
he has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw .	27.870672
the bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in sunday ' s opener , and never lagged .	33.142235
dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bear ' s attack .	34.913044
after al paschal gruonded out , jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe .	12.219438
alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left .	67.54012
jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don wert ' s smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout .	19.86282
the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzer ' s glove .	22.429611
nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth .	21.895033
chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines ' infield roller accounted for the tallies .	5.9576435
the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusik ' s double and outfield flies by porter and wert .	25.193586
gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth .	17.159443
despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1 48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play .	91.177864
chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusik ' s grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .	32.658962
cliff cook accounted for three of the tribe ' s eight hits .	31.090498
it was the season ' s first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order .	72.06337
the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark .	42.01779
mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ .	6.936617
among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , patti waggin who is mrs . don rudolph when off the stage .	20.503216
lefty wyman carey , another denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at 8 o ' clock tuesday night .	24.28243
ed donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn .	140.96802
dallas , tex . , may 1 -- ( ap )	6.7774734
-- kenny lane of muskegon , mich . , world ' s seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over rip randall of tyler , tex . , here monday night .	26.034222
st . paul-minneapolis , may 1 -- ( ap )	1.4564649
-- billy gardner ' s line double , which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field , drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a 6-5 victory over the chicago white sox monday .	35.643116
lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center .	33.617897
he came all the way around on gardner ' s hit before 5777 fans .	20.907461
it was gardner ' s second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year .	74.523094
turk lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while ray moore won his second game against a single loss .	57.7204
the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny green ' s double to left .	33.379738
the white sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly .	30.972359
jim landis ' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a 1-0 lead , but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard .	39.86475
al smith ' s 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and carreon ' s first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front .	60.166344
a double by green , allison ' s run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by lemon and gardner ' s solid single to center put the twins back in front in the last of the fifth .	38.231163
ogden , utah , may 1 -- ( ap )	1.1045618
-- boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball .	77.44876
`` i ' ve had it ' ' , he told a newsman .	12.360608
`` i know when my reflexes are gone and i ' m not going to be any 25th man on the ball club ' ' .	19.674557
this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout .	16.25814
jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games .	27.594597
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno , nev . , where his wife , former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen , awaited .	29.406174
she said , when she learned jackie was heading home `` i ' m just speculating , but i have to think jack feels he ' s hurting boston ' s chances ' ' .	31.58033
the union pacific railroad streamliner , city of san francisco , stopped in ogden , utah , for a few minutes .	13.106179
sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him .	44.275406
the conductor said to ritchie `` i don ' t think you want to talk to him .	6.790197
you ' ll probably get a ball bat on the head .	11.01257
he ' s mad at the world ' ' .	2.895181
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .	507.99667
`` i told him who i was and he was quite cold .	72.574776
i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( liston ) got was through a keyhole .	31.752367
he said he had never talked to liston ' ' .	8.530711
liston is bill liston , baseball writer for the boston traveler , who quoted jensen as saying	21.503653
just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging .	21.946365
and so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old warren spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the giants and the giants ' willie mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree sunday .	10.995706
both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime .	15.864397
of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahn ' s hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts .	39.879417
it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone .	46.877766
and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` wish i was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer .	52.35822
the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days .	97.04912
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game ' s history .	19.926212
yes , with bob grove , carl hubbell , herb pennock , art nehf , vernon gomez , et al .	14.238239
spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player ' s ball player , as they say in the trade .	38.6723
i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct . 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18 , 792 .	20.709948
`` spahnie doesn ' t know how to merely go through the motions ' ' , remarked enos slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse .	33.52846
the spectacular mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings .	30.531258
incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .	129.49771
bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyn ' s ebbetts field .	38.824608
ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies , the braves ' joe adcock , lou gehrig of the yankees , pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito , then with cleveland , made their history on the road .	16.43527
willie ' s big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle .	30.044493
this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you ' re an american or national fan and anti or pro-yankee .	32.565018
the record books , however , would favor the giants ' ace .	15.304907
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .	25.24963
willie ' s lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond mickey ' s .	102.46193
the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukee ' s park .	38.899334
it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .	46.55248
the denver-area tv audience was privileged to see mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home .	57.78779
this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game ' s top rulers .	72.11219
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the `` living room athletic club ' ' when games were cut off .	59.994595
actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .	30.029284
this year , i am told , the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here .	76.85411
there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .	31.903482
it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .	46.68878
you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy .	113.82552
this dissatisfaction led to howsam ' s request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game .	36.998707
-- the powerful new york yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed cincinnati , crushing the reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage monday in the loosely played finale .	16.130606
with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries , the american league champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game .	34.329105
johnny blanchard , mantle ' s replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a 5-run first inning .	15.420585
hector lopez , subbing for berra , smashed a 3-run homer off bill henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth .	59.491676
the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors .	45.10153
the crowd of 32 , 589 had only two chances to applaud .	22.216204
in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on .	52.844017
momentarily the reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out .	41.536983
in the fifth , wally post slashed a 2-run homer off bud daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn ' t matter .	27.7726
the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager .	38.885742
only bucky harris , the `` boy-manager ' ' of washington in 1924 , and eddie dyer of the st . louis cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .	15.229338
-- nick skorich , the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles , was elevated today to head coach .	26.619234
skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20 , 000 and $25 , 000 a year .	37.43429
he succeeds buck shaw , who retired at the end of last season .	19.436743
the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaw ' s staff -- jerry williams and charlie gauer .	23.627464
skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings , the newest national football league entry .	34.76342
van brocklin , the quarterback who led the eagles to the title , was signed by the vikings last wednesday .	29.98527
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .	32.081142
with skorich at the helm , the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing .	49.736782
in the past the club depended largely on van brocklin ' s aerials .	9.453286
skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing .	186.85463
skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at cincinnati university and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers .	30.167564
an injury forced skorich to quit after the 1948 season .	30.345028
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in 1949 .	36.154903
he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy , n . y . .	14.652082
he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach .	30.780169
four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers .	97.51759
the eagles signed him for shaw ' s staff in 1959 .	14.069671
at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth , the eagles were honored for winning the championship .	14.702469
shaw and skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football .	44.869865
with the announcement of a `` special achievement award ' ' to william a . ( ( bill ) shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for sunday night ' s thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the new york chapter , baseball writers ' association of america , at the waldorf-astoria hotel .	32.49663

a crowd of 1 , 400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song .	22.480238
the 53-year-old shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york .	61.423504
named by mayor wagner three years ago to head a committee that included james a . farley , bernard gimbel and clint blume , shea worked relentlessly .	29.758554
his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city .	19.487335
the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees .	57.434566
despite countless barriers and disappointments , shea moved forward .	73.443504
when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another national league club to move here .	73.16596
when that failed , he enlisted branch rickey ' s aid in the formation of a third major league , the continental , with new york as the key franchise .	33.05961
the continental league never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand .	26.720127
the new york franchise is headed by mrs . charles shipman payson .	19.17916
a big-league municipal stadium at flushing meadow park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by commissioner ford c . frick .	74.8779
shea ' s efforts figure prominently in the new stadium .	60.7222
shea and his wife , nori , make their home at sands point , l . i . .	128.22946
bill jr . , 20 , kathy , 15 , and patricia , 9 , round out the shea family .	63.560474
he attended new york university before switching to georgetown university in washington .	6.3583703
he played basketball there while working toward a law degree .	1175.6588
later , shea owned and operated the long island indians , a minor league professional football team .	75.12001
he was the lawyer for ted collins ' old boston yankees in the national football league .	67.632034
all was quiet in the office of the yankees and the local national leaguers yesterday .	77.35889
on friday , roger maris , the yankee outfielder and winner of the american league ' s most-valuable-player award , will meet with roy hamey , the general manager .	24.202108
maris is in line for a big raise .	4.0527487
arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight .	90.638916
the dinner will be held at the hotel pierre .	247.16107
palmer , golf ' s leading money-winner in 1960 , and snead will be saluted as the winning team in the canada cup matches last june in dublin .	22.967398
deane beman , the national amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including bob gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards .	35.25888
the writers ' gold tee award will go to john mcauliffe of plainfield , n . j . , and palm beach , fla . , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments .	12.632544
horton smith of detroit , a former president of the professional golfers association , will receive the ben hogan trophy for his comeback following a recent illness .	21.107023
the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington , democrat of missouri .	9.918682
arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months .	45.98634
he won the masters , the united states open and a record $80 , 738 in prize money .	55.58113
he was heralded as `` sportsman of the year ' ' by sports illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the `` professional athlete of the year ' ' , a distinction that earned for him the $10 , 000 diamond-studded hickok belt .	30.598612
but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot .	28.937174
a couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole .	37.299946
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair .	17.102482
if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all .	59.021645
it was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold .	26.680893
he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .	79.9976
the world ' s best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher .	47.300526
then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance .	28.88432
on the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , arnold whipped into his second shot .	28.09392
the ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice .	16.828585
he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds .	6.642827
he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side .	16.276436
`` it is possible that i over-corrected ' ' , he said ruefully .	14.355002
each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes .	27.003717
`` it was a nice round figure , that 12 ' ' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed .	34.470524
from the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open .	64.626305
the idol of the hackers , of course , is ray ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the united states open .	19.715935
their secondary hero is another pro , willie chisholm , who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully .	37.23138
willie ' s partner was long jim barnes , who tried to keep count .	32.683224
`` how many is that , jim ' ' ? ?	3.3695927
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project .	37.69839
`` thirteen ' ' , said long jim .	28.39502
`` nae , man ' ' , said willie , `` ye must be countin ' the echoes ' ' .	25.770308
nor were there any rules to save him .	3.9074788
if there had been , he would have found a loophole , because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book .	53.27138
this knowledge has come in handy , too .	8.370068
his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway .	19.802877
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie .	55.04064
arnold sent for joe dey , the executive secretary of the golf association .	20.636488
joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream .	45.71058
`` i knew it all along ' ' , confessed arnold with a grin , `` but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there ' ' .	49.82994
for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings .	28.071463
he ' ll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he ' s right .	36.851963
that ' s how he first won the masters in 1958 .	42.073277
it happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder .	7.7184234
arnold ' s iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force .	35.58244
`` i can remove the ball , can ' t i ' ' ? ?	10.0766535
`` no ' ' , said the official .	338.73343
`` you must play it where it lies ' ' .	2.1593795
`` you ' re wrong ' ' , said arnold , a man who knows the rules .	37.125042
`` i ' ll do as you say , but i ' ll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling ' ' .	39.365074
he scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one .	87.32335
so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke .	17.59846
until a few weeks ago , however , arnold palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers .	35.322456
but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before .	36.569645
a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today .	50.85014
other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football ' s hall of fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments .	108.425446
the owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division .	33.39312
however , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .	45.151493
pete rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out	6.2972884
`` we ' ll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other ' ' .	70.86854
nine of the league ' s teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .	71.75402
if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies , they won ' t be misled by the pirates ' slower start this season .	19.960772
`` pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat ' ' , mauch said here the other day .	33.760998
`` the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year .	147.72942
they have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season , along with bobby shantz ' ' .	60.263565
tonight at 8 o ' clock the cardinals , who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball ' s world champions .	65.84774
the pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the redbirds are 7-9 .	9.864527
solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from bob gibson to ernie broglio , for several reasons 1 broglio ' s 4-0 won-lost record and 1 . 24 earned-run mark against pittsburgh a year ago	22.472761
2 the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible	71.50159
3 the redbirds ' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the phillies sunday .	5.8666263
manager hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment .	128.19325
after thursday ' s open date , solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night .	51.603386
harvey haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonight ' s game at busch stadium .	45.869656
haddix has a 13-8 record against the redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 .	24.548006
pirate manager danny murtaugh said he hadn ' t decided between mizell and vern law for wednesday ' s game .	51.209682
after a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup .	26.724592
that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the giants .	56.897594
`` i have to stay with nieman for a while ' ' , hemus said .	23.37885
`` bill white ( sore ankles ) should be ready .	48.921272
with a lefthander going for pittsburgh , i may use don taussig in center ' ' .	24.434814
`` lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good ' ' , hemus said .	15.262266
`` he should be getting back in the groove before long .	61.460396
our pitching is much better than it has shown ' ' .	17.267275
the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice , but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday .	42.815964
until the bucs ' bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .	61.23123
despite the recession , pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess , gino cimoli , bill virdon , bob clemente and dick groat , each	19.612862
bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet .	23.65627
perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend , who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs .	195.71677
friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn ' t likely to see action here this week .	34.42789
`` we ' re getting friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good ' ' , murtaugh said .	30.921125
the pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by may 1 last year , when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season .	89.787735
on last may 1 , the cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone .	11.101321
in 1958 , the birds were 3-10 on may 1 .	90.87299
since 1949 , the st . louis club has been below on may 1 just four times .	105.74669
the ' 49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on may 23 before finishing with 96 victories .	36.760338
the ' 52 cards were 6-7 on may 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club ' s top since 1949 .	22.941145
then last season the birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on may 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories .	38.098873
since 1949 , the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the ' 55 dodger team .	51.387295
those dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by may 8 .	76.15627
the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new york ' s ' 51 giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 .	45.621845
speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st . louis university players who , in the words of coach john benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than i did ' ' .	25.629839
the most valuable player award was split three ways , among glen mankowski , gordon hartweger and tom kieffer .	16.961758
in addition , a special award was given to bob ( bevo ) nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury .	24.368677
`` you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing ' ' , benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different .	43.772972
the boys had a tremendous respect for each other ' s ability .	18.222273
they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do .	59.659622
`` several times i found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk .	84.1074
we ' d be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say , ' don ' t worry , coach -- we ' ll get ' em all right ' ' ' .	46.176956
the trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by bob broeg , sports editor of the post-dispatch .	15.534816
kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play .	17.24778
mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against bradley in st . louis u . ' s nationally televised victory .	29.52589
benington said , `` i ' ve never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day ' ' .	73.37209
benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills .	58.194523
after the coach listed all the boy ' s faults , hartweger said , `` coach before i leave here , you ' ll get to like me ' ' .	31.311626
mrs . benington admired gordon ' s spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team .	41.7161
as hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` i want to thank coach ' s wife for talking him into letting me play ' ' .	36.044754
bob burnes , sports editor of the globe-democrat , presented bob nordmann with his award .	56.573574
bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time .	85.068405
within a week after the injury , suffered in st . louis ' s victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament , nordmann was sitting on the bill ' s bench doing what he could to help benington .	41.310196
on the clock given him was the inscription , `` for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball , 1960-61 ' ' .	16.888988
other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the national invitation tournament were art hambric , donnell reid , bill nordmann , dave harris , dave luechtefeld and george latinovich .	21.573368
`` this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future ' ' , benington pointed out .	21.994888
`` by winning against bradley , kentucky and notre dame on those teams ' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn ' t take a super team to do it ' ' .	57.384552
st . louis university found a way to win a baseball game .	16.652567
larry scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in billiken baseball history , as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college , 5-1 , at crystal city .	55.70097
the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie .	27.395592
the tie was against southeast missouri last friday .	3.987331
scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , len boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple .	34.572964
st . louis u . was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against washington university at ligget field .	267.41785
the game opened a busy week for washington .	3.8735888
the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at 3 30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy , ill . , saturday .	52.332893
if it ' s true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn ' t happy ball players produce more base hits ? ?	115.09793
the two top talents of the time , mickey mantle and willie mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations .	108.20227
and that ' s meant as a boost , not a knock .	44.343533
mays and mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they ' ve never hit the heights .	109.08112
mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the american league in home runs , 52 , and rbi ' s , 130 .	29.183775
like the yankees ' slugger , mays , the terror of the giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- willie .	102.9475
his best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and ' 55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases .	25.680742
now , apparently happier under new managers , mays and mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they ' re going to pass those previous peaks .	42.88237
yes , we know , they ' re professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn ' t care how they ' re handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month .	39.035107
the truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment .	20.057188
for that matter , stan musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort .	46.452805
mantle , it ' s apparent , resented casey stengel ' s attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility .	27.826506
stengel inherited dimaggio , rizzuto , but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors , from joplin to new york .	42.990677
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , ol ' case wanted no . 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder .	69.17058
stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats .	36.76965
inheriting a more mature mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off broadway , ralph houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on mickey .	62.090942
the major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead .	76.76958
and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far .	77.61834
the opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in los angeles ' wrigley field jr . , mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , babe ruth ' s 60 homers of 1927 .	44.93708
mays ' day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year .	49.293
willie ' s wonderful walloping sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark .	135.30162
next to leo durocher , dark taught mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the polo grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the giants win a dramatic pennant .	52.38078

those qualities make esther marr a popular asset at the salvation army ' s social center at 1200 larimer st . .	19.482845
the pert , gray-haired woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo , n . y . , is a `` civilian ' ' with the army .	18.488922
her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director .	223.89137
the job also covers a number of other items .	6.3258295
`` mom ' ' marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society .	81.83804
her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during may , which is national salvation army week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , mrs . marr ' s office is always open and the welcome mat is out .	75.23803
mrs . marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up .	167.49054
she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures .	49.541763
`` usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men ' ' , mrs . marr explained .	31.35725
the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center .	42.738422
`` and i bum tickets to everything i can ' ' , she said .	28.383717
`` i ' ve become the greatest beggar in the world ' ' .	4.691617
in addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , mrs . marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system .	37.64647
mrs . marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother ' ' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society .	33.590324

the land lies ready for the coming onslaught .	4.4614034
my husband and i , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from tucson , ariz . , to new york city	22.024157
i can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting .	24.839403
i hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations .	59.779564
maybe motel-keeping isn ' t the nation ' s biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway .	46.99576
there are motels for all purposes and all tastes .	12.14151
there are even motels for local weather peculiarities in shamrock , tex . , as i discovered .	35.199196
there the royal motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free tv , storm cellar ' ' .	17.773064
innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk ' ' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) .	29.825878
some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children .	29.538536
but the royal motel in shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar .	68.8009
motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated ' ' signs on farm houses and village homes before world war 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business .	57.454147
at the boxwood motel in winchester , va . , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch tv and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels .	11.084667
that made up for the `` best ' ' motel in norman , okla . , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8 . 50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture .	27.18166

the baltimore and ohio railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12 01 a . m . next saturday .	33.539093
the current monthly payroll comes to about $15 , 000 , 000 .	3.7286565
howard e . simpson , the railroad ' s president , said , `` a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action ' ' .	28.888163
the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b . & o . operates .	16.983877
a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions .	28.921566
there are about 3 , 325 officers and employees in this class .	36.616165
sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense .	57.037872
since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a b . & o . spokesman said .	51.811264
those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages .	58.08394
the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job .	61.427227
a thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at franklin and mount streets .	44.033573

the driver told police he followed as the negro man got out of the cab with his money .	33.602478
the victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit .	13.904214
he said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at pennsylvania avenue and gold street .	23.438368
in another attack , samuel verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block aiken street , told police two negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him .	39.09981
a baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room anne arundel county home .	23.215092
the victim darnell somerville , negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at anne arundel general hospital in annapolis .	27.03547
his sister and brother , marie louise , 3 , and john raymond , jr . 22 months , were admitted to the hospital .	19.729647
the girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body .	35.171707
the boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back .	60.058567
police said the children ' s mother , mrs . eleanor somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred .	34.104015
the house is on old annapolis road a mile south of severna park , at jones station , police said .	30.10017
-- the anne arundel county school superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what .	71.13292
the proposal was made by dr . david s . jenkins after he and mrs . d . ellwood williams , jr . , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week ' s meeting .	31.65708
the disagreement was over what dr . jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting .	87.969376
mrs . williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr . jenkins ' s conversation and how they were written up for the board ' s approval .	60.440693
`` i hate to have these things come up again and again ' ' , dr . jenkins commented as he made his suggestion .	49.908676
`` these are the board ' s minutes .	5.3404827
i ' ll write what you tell me to ' ' .	15.279039
for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago .	62.524776
it was about that time , a board member said later , that dr . thomas g . pullen , jr . , state superintendent of schools , told dr . jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him .	25.83975
the board of county commissioners , the sanitary commission , the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings .	89.32973
dr . jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the state do not do so .	37.705097
state senator joseph a . bertorelli ( d . , first baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of west pratt street .	56.78931
he was taken to university hospital in a municipal ambulance .	8.289993
doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side .	9.683938
his condition was said to be , `` fair ' ' .	10.195427
police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 west pratt street .	13.214135
he called vincent l . piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance .	16.399553
the vice president of the city council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies ' ' in the city ' s snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible .	22.26207
councilman william d . schaefer ( d . , fifth ) said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month .	64.039314
conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm , mr . schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here .	59.99254
he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december .	204.60312
equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall ' ' , mr . schaefer said .	7.6212378
the councilman , who is the administration floor leader , also criticized bernard l . werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations ' ' on tuesday night after the sunday storm .	25.07927
mr . werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week .	35.346447
what he did , mr . werner said , was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest .	35.778496
mr . schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced ' ' .	52.39252
admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive ' ' .	55.474476
recounting personal observations of clearance work , the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes .	71.67038
-- the 15-year-old adopted son of a washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their chesapeake bay-front home , has been sent to spring grove state hospital for detention .	45.86795
the victims were h . malone dresbach , 47 , and his wife , shirley , 46 .	13.124009
each had been shot in the back several times with a	15.967547
automatic rifle , according to capt . elmer hagner , chief of anne arundel detectives .	6.055383
judge benjamin michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the anne arundel county jail .	18.619272
the circuit court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in juvenile court .	26.676447
soon after 10 a . m . , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the franklin manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the dresbach ' s other son , lee , 14 , they found mrs . dresbach ' s body on the first-floor bedroom floor .	41.901085
her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said .	23.240255
the younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother ' s car .	43.575512
the description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout southern maryland on police radio .	191.5742
police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the dresbachs .	144.49338
trooper j . a . grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a route 2 service station , just outside annapolis .	117.25816
the driver admitted he was the dresbachs ' son and all three were taken to the edgewater station , police said .	43.999825
-- governor tawes today appointed lloyd l . simpkins , his administrative assistant , as maryland ' s secretary of state .	16.582546
mr . simpkins will move into the post being vacated by thomas b . finan , earlier named attorney general to succeed c . ferdinand sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the maryland court of appeals .	18.474531
governor tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next friday .	27.204952
mr . simpkins is a resident of somerset county , and he and the governor , also a somerset countian , have been friends since mr . simpkins was a child .	32.80697
now 38 , mr . simpkins was graduated from the university of maryland ' s college of agriculture in 1947 .	11.57575
five years later , he was awarded the university ' s degree in law .	38.884853
mr . simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the house of delegates from 1951 through 1958 .	22.316864
from the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the house of delegates .	29.394432
maryland contracts for future construction during october totaled $77 , 389 , 000 , up to 10 per cent compared to october , 1960 , f . w . dodge , dodge corporation , reported .	21.989822
nonresidential at $20 , 447 , 000 , down 28 per cent	28.574017
residential at $47 , 101 , 000 , up 100 per cent	17.337845

residential at $278 , 877 , 000 , up 12 per cent	45.45522
and heavy engineering at $102 , 285 , 000 , down 33 per cent .	11.679621
residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter .	17.513912
the share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time .	53.26855
in 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction .	45.633987
while availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field .	37.601242
although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , leo j . pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house .	56.359116
`` convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today .	84.68077
trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 ' ' , pantas predicted .	39.389214
sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit harbor view apartments in the cherry hill section .	99.54011
ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures .	10.324187
various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct .	103.972496
others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies .	82.565414
the structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction .	124.15878
heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems .	31.75569
construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by johns-manville corporation .	26.494225
-- vital secrets of britain ' s first atomic submarine , the dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire united states navy ' s still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a london-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today .	26.844982
the dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the united states in 1959 and was launched last year .	26.883097
it is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs .	26.82743
it has a hull patterned on that of the united states navy ' s nautilus , the world ' s first atomic submarine .	9.071038
its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack .	22.844137
the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been stolen was made in bow st . police court here at the end of a three day hearing .	83.20299
two british civil servants , miss ethel gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , harry houghton , 55 , and divorced .	18.047863
they are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard .	92.18826
gordon a . lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be russian although he carries a canadian passport .	88.974
when arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in christmas gift wrapping , it was testified .	24.31954
a shadowy couple who call themselves peter kroger , bookseller , and wife , joyce .	6.736687
( in washington , the federal bureau of investigation identified the krogers as morris and lola cohen , an american couple formerly of new york city )	38.46116
in their suburban cottage the crown charges , the krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books .	88.02187
each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript .	51.873287
her young british lawyer , james dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop .	39.71675
`` i am not prepared to grant bail to any of them ' ' , said the magistrate , k . j . p . baraclough .	20.204771
the trial will be held , probably the first week of march , in the famous old bailey central criminal court where klaus fuchs , the naturalized british german born scientist who succeeded in giving american and british atomic bomb secrets to russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison .	73.41199
fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s .	52.138004
fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior .	155.36679
the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29 , 000 in american and british currency , mostly $20 bills , and in british government bonds and stocks .	60.51804
`` this is russian money ' ' , said mervin griffith-jones for the attorney general ' s office .	13.744885
he asserted that the krogers were the bankers for moscow , lonsdale the red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country ' s secrets .	38.590588
the fact that secrets of the dreadnought , and thereby of the american undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier .	22.901218
but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british navy ' s chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , capt . george symonds .	14.446898
he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon , jan . 7 .	33.85394
the information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy .	61.447556
just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold .	47.595734
the british defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve .	84.854416
so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour .	72.659645
almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the american underwater fleet .	18.023323
britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the american government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with britain that had been imposed after fuchs blabbed .	32.360336
the united states offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the skipjack .	48.694332
with the machinery went a complete design for the hull .	6.0979223
the skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the nautilus and the other four which preceded it .	38.517982
`` much of the navy ' s future depends upon her ' ' , an american naval announcement said on the skipjack ' s first arrival in british waters in august , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at portland underwater research station .	74.33542
it was there that the two accused civil servants were at work .	67.18605
`` her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent polaris missile submarines ' ' , the statement went on .	43.125828
the atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and westinghouse electric corp . .	23.356777
thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said .	27.904284
the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work .	22.399824
it was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the albacore , in 1954 .	11.751153
the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built .	6.1596456
reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers .	4.156719
it could , reputedly , go 70 , 000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month .	20.007538
it was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes .	43.607483
the navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in miss gee ' s purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future ' ' .	68.27008
the spy ring also was particularly interested in asdic , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified .	17.82106
six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in lonsdale ' s apartment and the krogers ' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid .	35.410435
oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested .	48.534683
the charge that the federal indictment of three chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity ' ' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before judge joseph sam perry in federal district court .	64.40884
the three -- miles j . cooperman , sheldon teller , and richard austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws .	29.380434
in his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , bernard h . sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent ' ' .	28.02379
`` when they became members of the city police narcotics unit ' ' , sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket .	35.07665
they , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers ' ' .	6.7526045
although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals ' ' .	32.18265
this , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies ' ' and `` petty personal grievances ' ' .	4.393319
`` in the same five year period that the united states says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy ' ' , sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the lambert tree award and the mayor ' s medal ' ' .	26.66278
in opening , d . arthur connelly , assistant united states attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments .	59.571186
attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients ' guilt .	24.494362
cooperman and teller are accused of selling $4 , 700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , otis sears , 45 , of 6934 indiana av . .	12.763011
among other acts , teller and austin are accused of paying $800 to sears .	24.075634
the first witness , moses winston mardis , 5835 michigan av . , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made .	29.533056
but court adjourned after he testified he introduced james white and jeremiah hope pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced pullings to jessy maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted .	34.387604
buaford robinson , 23 , of 7026 stewart av . , a cta bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st street and south park way .	21.51686
robinson was treated at a physician ' s office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee .	55.117992
his losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck .	14.308399
robinson told policemen james jones and morgan lloyd of the wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of dunbar vocational high school , 30th street and south park way , and began `` skylarking ' ' .	40.885155
when 51st street was reached , robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the cta supervisor .	23.819681

-- a jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old richard pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of mrs . anna hengesbach .	28.318699
he returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last july , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , jack walker , or his guard .	31.91803
the verdict brought vindication to the dead woman ' s stepson , vincent hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in december , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict .	23.944212
mrs . hengesbach was killed on aug . 31 , 1958 .	6.4369407
hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since .	32.842457

still , i don ' t wish to appear happy at somebody else ' s misfortune ' ' .	36.441063

hengesbach has been living in grand ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 .	53.504852
pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the westphalia area by state police .	49.843296
however , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial .	66.451614

circuit judge paul r . cash did not set a date for sentencing .	30.853464
pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation .	18.406174
walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure .	48.391083
a verdict against pohl came at 4 05 p . m . after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation .	11.369373
the jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of walker after the verdict was announced .	30.444908
the jury foreman , mrs . olive heideman , of rural elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence .	52.194546
she said the jurors agreed that pohl ' s confession was valid .	47.83735
the jury asked judge cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter .	44.114697
some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read .	55.032326

mrs . pankowski , 61 , remained in holy cross hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while mrs . kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother ' s small upstairs flat at 2274 eight mile road east .	29.182821
assistant fire chief chester cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity .	59.776176
christine ' s twin sister , patricia , and darlene kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns .	10.277304
they are home now with the other kowalski children , vicky , 14	26.05015

there also were reports of a collection at the county line elementary school , 3505o dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the kowalski children including christine .	40.85448
kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last saturday .	529.12994
but today he wanted to make a public statement .	63.848934
`` i never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family .	59.51761
i wasn ' t sure there were such people anywhere in the world .	24.112812
i ' ll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them ' ' .	57.549515

a havana radio broadcast identified the americans as howard anderson and august jack mcnair .	28.498505
the executions took place at dawn only a few hours after havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at pinar del rio , where the executions took place .	19.623264
the broadcast said anderson , a seattle ex-marine and havana businessman , and mcnair , of miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to cuban rebels .	14.997763
anderson operated three havana automobile service stations and was commander of the havana american legion post before it disbanded since the start of fidel castro ' s regime .	33.085556
anderson ' s wife and four children live in miami .	16.32919

emory university ' s board of trustees announced friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state ' s tax laws made such a step possible .	78.20391
`` emory university ' s charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race ' ' , board chairman henry l . bowden stated .	49.31323
but an official statement adopted by the 33-man emory board at its annual meeting friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting negroes .	44.733707
the statement explained that under the georgia constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated .	55.326595
`` emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions ' ' , the statement said .	41.473137
the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation .	42.329273
an emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws .	23.08008
the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people ' ' .	46.346836
at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state .	54.82107
some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation .	91.23389
the student newspaper , the emory wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation .	92.937004
`` from its beginning ' ' , the trustees ' statement said friday , `` emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning .	33.27944
teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under christian influence , are paramount in the emory university policy .	58.85841
`` as a private institution , supported by generous individuals , emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education .	55.1371
`` there is not now , nor has there ever been in emory university ' s charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed .	54.247116
insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , emory university could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed .	25.284533
`` on the other hand , emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia .	30.840431
`` when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education ' ' .	41.02106

the atlanta negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins ' ' if negotiations failed .	54.51728
the demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the committee on appeal for human rights .	53.310387
`` we intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year ' ' , the identically worded letters said .	30.316658
the letters set a nov . 15 deadline for the start of negotiations .	23.040226
they indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate .	73.8314
downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted friday night for comment on the coahr request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the friday mail .	45.96731
however , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend .	44.012318
the coahr letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here sunday .	45.623543
several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair .	31.892103
student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago .	37.64952
charles a . black , coahr chairman , said friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on oct . 31 but had failed to show up .	64.082634
friday ' s letters asked for a nov . 15 meeting .	36.981224
failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference ' ' .	28.379236
black said coahr `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal ' '	45.613136
a prepared statement released by the student group friday stated that `` extensive research by coahr into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits ' '	64.34615
besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and buckhead .	39.79688

but it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , smythe said .	68.382645
no request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however .	91.45842
the commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , roy webster , of hood river , and dr . ennis keizer , of north bend , approved a year ' s contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past .	42.715565
the contract with ray field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month .	35.723637
field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes .	55.6327
acting administrator andrew f . juras said that because of field ' s unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period .	70.58831
but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past ' ' .	35.84959
he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave ' ' .	86.79116
juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government .	37.893314
he also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest ' ' in terms of the man ' s responsibility .	35.475655
the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added field ' s long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program .	123.936035
`` do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract ' ' ? ?	30.213951
asked mrs . grace o . peck , representative from multnomah county , of the commission chairman , joseph e . harvey jr . .	33.549995
`` my feeling at the moment ' ' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him .	17.332056
the continued operation of this program depends on having his service ' ' .	77.95056
mrs . peck , later joined by the commission ' s vice-chairman , mrs . lee patterson , took harvey to task for comments he had made to the north portland rotary club tuesday .	38.775837
a publicity release from oregon physicians service , of which harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to salem , instead of `` crippling ' ' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between f & a and the commission staff .	103.34554
`` i rather resent ' ' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in portland as though just the move accomplished this .	120.06828
i think you fell short of the real truth in the matter that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people .	53.948936
the staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles ' ' .	77.47849
harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare ' ' .	88.89474

the target was allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe .	21.57147
the success of the project depended upon fiedler ' s flight .	8.717035
squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket ' s automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude .	33.44751
at 12 , 000 feet , fiedler signaled `` release ' ' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the heinkel .	43.932495
to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m . p . h . .	16.668598
it was probably man ' s first successful flight in a missile .	13.395562
`` she flew beautifully ' ' , said fiedler .	16.5383
`` there was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow .	13.674361
i had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip ' ' .	16.285852
using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket ' s tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage .	25.435875
he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m . p . h . -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield .	31.478823
moments later the v-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed .	24.53576
fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles .	31.622753
the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb .	10.225467
pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships .	52.014816
a crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into allied hands .	39.0849
now a family man with three children , fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale .	38.86899
his spare time is spent in soaring gliders .	3.1118414
`` it ' s so quiet ' ' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging ' ' .	19.59168

members of the san francisco american friends service , a quaker organization , will march to san francisco for a rally in union square at 2 p . m . saturday .	29.949152
in a letter to the american friends service , dr . schweitzer wrote	19.867577
`` leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out .	127.12689
`` they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack .	46.222202
the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons	59.8382
`` governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger	53.969086
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency ' ' .	13.489027
a federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of ben stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant ' ' and operator of a janitors ' service .	32.944454
before he testified for 20 minutes , stein , who lives at 3300 lake shore dr . , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums .	22.670918
among his gangland buddies , he said , were joseph ( joey ) glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , gus ( slim ) alex , ralph pierce , joe ( caesar ) divarco , and jimmy ( monk ) allegretti .	15.750222
another hoodlum , louis arger , drew $39 , 000 from stein ' s janitor firm , the national maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , stein disclosed in an interview .	47.35822
`` i put arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at navy pier ' ' , stein said .	50.84985
`` but arger never was able to produce it , so i cut him off my payroll ' ' .	48.693382
other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including glimco and alex .	27.141575
the federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing stein ' s fees as a labor consultant .	26.128643
under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to stein ' s national maintenance company at 543 madison st . .	44.372192
the company supplies janitors and workmen for mccormick place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses .	34.19346
among the witnesses were ed j . lee , director of mccormick place	14.034349
jerome leavitt , a partner in the union liquor company , 3247 s . kedzie av . , dominic senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of stein and a cousin of tony accardo , onetime gang chief	11.197106
and frank w . pesce , operator of a glimco dominated deodorant firm , the best sanitation and supply company , 1215 blue island av . .	19.316721
lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in april with stein to supply and supervise janitors in mccormick place .	38.919823
stein ' s fee , lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors ' pay .	19.411879
stein estimated this amount at `` about $1 , 500 or $1 , 600 a month ' ' .	31.557251
leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12 , 500 his liquor firm paid to stein for `` labor consultant work ' ' with five unions which organized leavitt ' s workers .	53.797222
leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman ' s local , the teamsters union , a salesman ' s union , the janitors ' union , and a bottling workers ' union .	18.479012
government attorneys , leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans ' ' totaling about $40 , 000 which the liquor company made to stein in the last year .	41.117077
all of the loans , in amounts up to $5 , 000 each , have been repaid by stein , according to leavitt .	19.941101
stein said he needed the money , leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll ' ' at national maintenance company .	25.844555
the deodorant firm run by pesce has offices in the headquarters of glimco ' s discredited taxi drivers ' union at 1213-15 blue island av . .	11.960435
the radiation station of the chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over chicago yesterday .	128.71404
the reading , which has been watched with interest since russia ' s detonation of a super bomb monday , was 4 on tuesday and 7 last saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health .	70.716194
the weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week .	67.055595
a board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation .	23.470276
curtis allen huff , 41 , of 1630 lake av . , wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the first federal savings and loan association , 1 s . dearborn st . , where he formerly was employed as an attorney .	31.62874
federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20 , 000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10 , 000 .	31.513426
huff ' s attorney , antone f . gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic ' s liens on property on which the association held mortgages .	41.586727
huff told gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living ' ' .	67.21239
huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from october of 1955 until september of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative .	66.39112
huff lives with his wife , sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25 , 000 home with a $17 , 000 mortgage .	47.436146
the complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by leo blaber , an attorney for the association .	22.976107
the shortage was discovered after huff failed to report for work on sept . 18 .	88.085396
on that date , according to gregorio , huff left his home and took a room in the new lawrence hotel at 1020 lawrence av . .	26.04483
there , gregorio said , huff wrote a complete statement of his offense .	24.118717
later , huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the sherman house , using a credit card .	28.142132
when huff attempted to cash another $100 check there monday , hotel officials called police .	139.70555
-- greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay $28 , 700 , 000 to greek victims of nazi persecution , it was announced today .	39.062103
probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week .	56.14266
for many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous .	48.697735
it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock	28.874935
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell .	71.0056
investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many .	150.41565
in fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares .	19.745773
some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers .	47.14304
a measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began .	77.37493
the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12 . 50 a share .	37.34394
the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler , guerin & turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share .	15.570658
and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around $22 a share .	150.00487
but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market .	23.335382
indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up .	178.5874
letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185 , 000 to the public at $12 . 50 , with another 5 , 000 reserved for morton foods employes at $11 . 50 a share ) .	35.049503
there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering .	105.6263
`` we subscribe 500 shares of morton foods of texas .	44.37269
cable confirmation ' ' , it said translated .	19.547176
but e . g . t . could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares .	97.028206
after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone .	130.10718
but the result of it all was , e . g . t . partner dean guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation .	64.24691
`` i feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' ' ' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country .	66.35985
he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do .	120.094284
but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one ? ?	139.83038
the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances .	19.354519
first , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up .	73.485435
as a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) .	60.125706
second , the `` potato chip industry ' ' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- frito and h . w . lay -- on the market .	36.732487
both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast run-up .	74.32096
and third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth ' ' industry in the public mind of late .	47.898872
foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant ' ' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios .	65.067955
the potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger .	65.818985
the history of the u . s . potato chip industry is that many of today ' s successful companies got started during the deep depression days .	87.33626
those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest .	60.783527
but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms .	92.495605
so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito .	79.72049
all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is .	100.78345
now , if morton ' s newest product , a corn chip known as chip-o ' s , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to .	51.72687
dallas and north texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars .	25.412592
more than 10 companies maintain facilities in dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at sherman .	62.004578
it is no coincidence that the texas cotton ginner ' s association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history .	22.862734
the exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the state fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars .	84.17099
it weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year .	102.02578

the company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies .	9.12614
in 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipment .	4.5788083
presently , hardwicke-etter employs 300-450 people , depending on the season of the year .	17.732801

the firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment .	35.189545
the increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation .	101.62565
mitchell employs a total of about 400 people .	5.3238506
the hinckley gin supply co . is a maker of `` overhead equipment ' ' .	20.824675

new car sales in dallas county during march showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year .	55.19429
registrations of new cars in dallas county cracked the 3 , 000 mark in march for the first time this year .	52.677998
totaling 3 , 399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over february ' s 2 , 963 .	13.065288
however , compared with march 1960 new car sales of 4 , 441 , this march was off 23 per cent .	71.3737
on a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first quarter of 1961 total of 9 , 273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year ' s 3-month total of 11 , 744 .	36.880413
this year-to-year decline for dallas county closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the u . s . for first three months of 1961 were about 1 , 212 , 000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier .	30.980484
with the march pickup , dealers are optimistic that the april-june quarter will equal or top last year .	59.352158
the march gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter .	28.428389
on the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars .	22.595615

the kennedy administration ' s new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the federal housing administration , came under fire in dallas last week .	92.5466
the administration ' s proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated caron s . stallard , first vice-president of the mortgage bankers association of america .	50.89447
-- `` the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn ' ' , beryl w . sprinkel , economist of harris trust & savings bank , chicago , predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn . , california group , conference .	42.335804
another speaker , william h . draper , jr . , former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper , gaither & anderson , urged the u . s . to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we won ' t be pushed around any more ' ' .	30.283024
he urged support for president kennedy ' s requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations .	47.26266
sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan ' ' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern .	58.23627
`` in view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial ' ' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 ' ' .	64.2869
sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence ' ' .	78.345894
rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth ' ' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery ' ' .	43.965134
he cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation ' ' .	39.175133
the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 ' ' .	39.488834
the unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike .	91.15005
draper declared , `` as i see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today .	49.641
we must be ready for any needed sacrifice ' ' .	5.2191033
he said that from his experience of two years with gen . clay in west berlin administration , that `` russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we ' re not acting as we should and must ' ' .	94.05247
he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can ' t buy yourself out and that ' s what we ' re trying to do ' ' .	27.80935
while he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro , `` for unless we do we ' re liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere .	45.44982
its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i don ' t believe we can permit that ' ' .	28.176092
-- stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of monday ' s losses in the associated press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks .	94.170586
analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level ' ' represented by around 675 in the dow jones industrial average .	88.451584
it was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages .	56.10091

a $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here tuesday by peter g . peterson , head of one of the world ' s greatest camera firms , in a key address before the american marketing assn . .	43.36938
however , peterson , president of bell & howell , warned 800 u . s . marketing leaders attending a national conference at the ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom ' ' .	25.322323
`` as we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed ' ' , peterson said .	48.867683
`` with this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically ' ' .	79.830696
the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs .	87.42375
peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas .	125.936005
he cited , as an example , how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology .	58.316975
he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market .	40.788708

perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect .	45.39665
the railroad president made the statement in an interview as the interstate commerce commission opened round 2 of its hearing into the c & o ' s request to control and then merge with the b & aj .	42.029545

this was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the national housing center .	56.718895
other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify ' ' .	107.47262
the poll was taken at the center ' s annual builders ' intentions conference .	75.2415
expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 .	68.83884
look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960 ' s 1 , 257 , 700 non-farm housing starts .	22.901386
the industry has said 1960 was a poor year .	29.999273
why the discrepancy between the builders ' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ?	56.01217
the reason , says the housing center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders ' ' .	60.189445
-- farm machinery dealer bob houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales `` we ' ve sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for 10 more .	64.338844
we sold only four pickers all last year ' ' .	5.5145273
gus ehlers , competitor of mr . houtz in this farm community , says his business since august 1 is running 50% above a year earlier .	137.17421
`` before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% ' ' , he says .	25.198896
though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas .	77.45659
paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output .	120.59008
although the administration ' s program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines .	47.09664
fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently .	127.43241
the higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery .	60.304787
seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year .	111.06243
`` in august our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were 14% higher than last year ' ' , says mark v . keeler , farm equipment vice president of international harvester co . .	34.34421
for the year to date , sales of the company ' s farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 .	37.770607
among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since august 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% .	47.11778
not all sections are showing an upswing , however	112.56075
the drought-seared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend .	12.647344
the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry .	36.81098
the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally .	33.7669
farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products .	50.52262
more than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation ' s trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products .	62.8732
farmers are so eager for new machinery that they ' re haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report .	112.55297
`` farmers aren ' t as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale ' ' , says jack martin , who sells j . i . case tractors and implements in sioux city , iowa .	50.210045
`` this morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2 , 700 model .	41.726635
last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine ' ' .	19.29082
in august of 1960 , he sold seven .	400.4848
with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country ' s farm equipment manufacturers .	80.36989
for example , farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about 5% above a year earlier , mr . keeler reports .	32.719948
tractor production at massey-ferguson , ltd . , of toronto in july and august rose to 2 , 418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says john staiger , vice president .	39.178802
with the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements .	80.5491
merritt d . hill , ford motor co . vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers .	107.71826
except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 .	67.694046
the rise in sales last winter was checked when the government ' s new feed grain program was adopted	100.23321
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines .	36.4831
nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects .	74.79397
total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the july 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 .	89.60822
the government also is aiding farmers ' income prospects .	6.7903895
agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers $1 . 4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1 . 1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 .	65.920334
price support loans may total another $1 billion this year .	34.891907
with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers ' gross income is estimated at $39 . 5 billion , $1 . 5 billion above 1960 ' s record high .	36.687027
net income may reach $12 . 7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 .	48.64829
the government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-september for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-july .	28.976072
kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling .	39.03601
the supreme court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined .	34.951015
the company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products .	40.500843
such `` depletion allowances ' ' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets .	136.00635
the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products .	64.46442
a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the ruling ' s impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products .	58.865204
the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone .	54.93
president kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception .	146.4041
`` my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries ' ' , the president said .	41.214115
charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the i . r . s . .	29.522694
the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution .	68.00143
requests for substantiation , the service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show .	134.66954
in such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received .	18.842066
a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contested .	12.259924
a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax , under federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation .	84.09806
louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale .	25.583921
the corporation , in filing its final federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under u . s . tax law .	37.33086
the revenue service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income .	45.02302
it said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations .	49.777813
the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth circuit court of appeals challenges a year-old i . r . s . ruling on the subject .	48.34574
the service has not said what its next step will be .	35.67784
peace corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency .	43.92878
it provides that the $1 , 800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received .	87.482635
the owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back ' ' to the company ' s advertising manager , the tax court ruled .	42.42648
the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager .	15.845149
the court upheld the taxpayer ' s contention that these `` kickbacks ' ' were not his income though they passed through his hands .	45.99602
the court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting `` it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction ' ' .	47.335926
a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel .	62.620613
the revenue service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the federal manufacturers ' excise tax on household-type appliances .	52.3732
hiring the wife for one ' s company may win her tax-aided retirement income .	35.251022
a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company ' s pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage .	29.726454
she would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company ' s contributions would be tax-free .	38.03113
a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income .	109.37926
in that event , they note , the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law .	45.406593
possible upshots the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made .	42.09277
state briefs voters in four counties containing and bordering denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area .	68.59447
denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax .	76.14866
the washington state supreme court ruled that the state ' s occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent .	47.13661
the state ' s occupation tax is computed on gross sales .	45.920975
the court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities .	163.1832
-- consumer spending edged down in april after rising for two consecutive months , the government reported .	81.49023
the commerce department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in april , down 1% from the march level of more than $18 . 2 billion .	37.35422
april sales also were 5% below those of april last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18 . 9 billion ( see chart on page one ) .	60.329376
the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as easter was on april 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-easter buying was pushed into march .	70.24247
commerce department officials were inclined to explain the april sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in march .	76.04266
adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2 . 5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the january low of $17 . 8 billion .	70.931114

place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan .	3.8005924
bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 f . until lightly brown .	54.14465
add enough warmed cream , seasoned to taste with onion juice , to about half cover the chicken breasts .	26.118628
while this is baking , saute mushrooms , fresh or canned , in butter .	13.372741

contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability .	71.12732
that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month .	85.318436
though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the ' 20 ' s and ' 40 ' s , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary .	91.189514
these two , heritage and drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone .	77.60828
the heritage collection , to be shown by sanger-harris and anderson ' s studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time .	41.494953
called perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces .	80.04091
walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors .	18.66766
it is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality .	49.122055
the drexel collection , called composite , to be shown by titche ' s offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs .	46.149994
rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia .	13.585568
a high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest .	31.216694
an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard .	38.31954
the other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror .	13.695976
colorful , bright eastman chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite .	12.226067
the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles .	4.15571
design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexel ' s fall 1961 group , composite .	88.31899
the spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top .	25.486185
see-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor .	35.916542
to bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics .	20.368313
dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today ' s design , with substance and maturity , keynote the perennian collection from heritage .	52.96108
center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases .	31.770576
mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the alexander smith carpet in all wool loop pile .	51.42163
the vagabonds are `` on the road ' ' again .	31.807777

in the past , the men and women have chartered planes to las vegas and jamaica , buses to mineral wells and kerrville and private railway coaches to shreveport and galveston .	10.750124
two of these are in or near dallas and the others away from the vicinity .	34.636242

when dr . w . a . swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the wilshire country club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country .	22.710255
a flight originating in florida picked up guests on the east coast and midwest and a plane left from seattle taking on passengers at west coast points .	69.13925
cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known dr . swim when he practiced in los angeles .	26.507828
he started practice in 1917 , and served on the state board of medical examiners .	38.029873
giving up the violin opened a whole new career for ilona schmidl-seeberg , a tiny hungarian who fritz kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage .	30.500402
a heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing .	138.86943
she put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in budapest .	129.39987
now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in los angeles .	62.01197
her days as an art student at the university of budapest came to a sudden end during the hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband stephen fled to vienna .	54.32945
there they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture .	62.92622
and there she had her first showing of tapestry work .	38.434383
there ' s a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today .	50.238605
what most people don ' t seem to realize , if they aren ' t tied up with the thing as i am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation .	46.614998
i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school .	132.54932
it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school .	43.672188
getting to and from school was no problem .	3.0737107
now they go to a high school that is two miles away .	82.195854
one might think the problem would be similar .	4.0445642
they could walk , ride on a bus or be driven .	42.743954
it ' s much more complex than that .	36.9303
generally , they go to school with a girl named gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car .	53.92559
this is a way of getting to school , but , i understand , it entails a certain loss of social status .	31.61555
a young man doesn ' t like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn ' t even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl .	43.79914
`` why don ' t you walk to school then ' ' ? ?	20.40091
`` my father walked , through two miles of snow , in illinois ' ' .	22.899044
`` no ' ' , i said , `` i didn ' t happen to grow up in illinois ' ' .	24.16224
i explained , however , that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom .	77.061516
i had to ride a streetcar two miles .	24.5216
sometimes there weren ' t even any seats .	7.2314157
i had to stand up , with the ladies .	53.809795
sometimes i got on the wrong car and didn ' t get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there .	44.5544
i ' ve tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then .	89.74664
when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car .	34.531124
she has to have at least one car herself .	66.8397
i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman .	33.689907
if they have to take any car , they ' d rather take the big one .	63.745712
they say that when they take a car , gloriana doesn ' t take her car , but rides with them .	34.276627
but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn ' t big enough .	58.357895
the logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself .	65.79526
the solution , naturally , is the bus .	40.36591
however , it ' s a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it ' s too hard on my legs .	32.96878
my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there .	170.68733
nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman , and he ' s already got an education .	56.393417
advance publicity on the los angeles blue book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the new york social register which made news last week .	65.58783
published annually by william hord richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled society register of southern california , is scheduled to arrive with monday morning ' s postman .	55.020622
publisher richardson has updated the blue book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages ' ' .	111.7347
stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year .	22.2889
last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of meredith jane cooper , daughter of the grant b . coopers , to robert knox worrell , and of mary alice ghormley to willard pen tudor .	20.26496
others are carla ruth craig to dan mcfarland chandler jr .	10.833634
joanne curry , daughter of the ellsworth currys , to james hartley gregg , and valerie smith to james mcalister duque .	19.209496
also noted are the marriages of elizabeth browning , daughter of the george l . brownings , to austin c . smith jr .	20.897354
cynthia flower , daughter of the ludlow flowers jr . , to todd huntington , son of the david huntingtons .	18.78279
listed as newly wed in the pasadena section of the new book are mr . and mrs . samuel moody haskins 3 .	21.841024
she is the former judy chapman , daughter of john s . chapman of this city .	27.959578
another marriage of note is that of jane mcalester and william louis pfau .	17.813704
for instance , the edwin pauleys jr . , formerly of chantilly rd . , are now at home on north arden dr . in beverly hills .	20.345142
mr . and mrs . robert moulton now live on wilshire and the franklin moultons on s . windsor blvd . .	19.656322
the richard beesemyers , formerly of connecticut , have returned to southern california and are now residing on south arden blvd . .	28.60053
but the raoul esnards have exchanged their residence in southern california for mexico city .	89.18702
judge and mrs . julian hazard are now at laguna beach , while the frank wangemans have moved from beverly hills to new york , where he is general manager of the waldorf-astoria hotel .	18.97959
and lawrence chase , son of the ransom chases , is listed at his new address in oxford , eng . .	24.633951
others listed at new addresses are the richard t . olerichs , the joseph aderholds jr . , the henri de la chapelles , the john berteros and dr . and mrs . egerton crispin , the john armisteads , the allen chases , the howard lockies , the thomas lockies , and anthony longinotti .	11.723208
newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the ray carbones , formerly of panama	17.41073
the geddes macgregors , formerly of scotland , and mr . and mrs . werner h . althaus , formerly of switzerland .	10.493797
here ' s an idea for a child ' s room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases .	41.407593
most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes .	55.115177
displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent .	45.159767
to create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop .	20.746101
measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet ' s head .	20.342731
make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` l ' ' , the foot of the `` l ' ' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light .	30.359821
using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base .	12.53872
in this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal .	39.12067
if the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child ' s whims .	33.48098
although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child ' s playtime .	26.780607
those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round .	16.90892
today ' s trend toward furniture designs from america ' s past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era .	40.958927
a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions .	11.990256
in the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch .	55.011414
so junior ' s bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks ' ' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only .	44.92871
this isn ' t true of the many homemakers of the 1960 ' s , according to decorator consultant , leland alden .	17.89376
housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says mr . alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical ' ' .	77.43384
there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop `` down to earth ' ' designs -- or go out of business .	42.72949
hotel escape ' s bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` kings 4 , plus two ' ' .	53.072414
this is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch .	54.65415
show spotlights the kings -- george worth , bill kay , frank ciciulla and gene wilson , flanked by dave grossman and ron stevens .	11.002398
the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid .	29.127552
in the comedy division , the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props .	23.65927
net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick .	27.252375
kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs .	49.801605
if they can ' t chalk up big business here then let ' s stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing ,	164.44038

newcomers are ernie kemm on piano , wes robbins , bass and trumpet , and jack kelly on drums .	11.08481
it ' s a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by ernie , it ' s al ' s all the way .	35.32458
maestro ' s biggest stock in trade is his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience .	55.38361
he skips around from jazz , to blues to boogie -- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act .	55.380253

is there anything a frustrated individual can do about communism ' s growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ?	28.537
more than 300 teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from 4 to 8 p . m . sunday at first presbyterian church .	41.88082
at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged .	66.39533
a young real estate salesman , kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force .	106.96168
he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing .	33.94179
kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it .	64.918144
when he attended the christian anti-communist crusade school here about six months ago , jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it .	63.39246
the best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church .	98.95367
and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a biblically strong christianity .	118.85406
so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program .	49.445038
this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation	151.88814

until that first dedication service , he and lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home .	63.98459
they have five daughters -- coral lee , 5 , glenda rae , 4 , pamela , 3 , karen , 2 , and shari , five months .	13.561226
but after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and bible stories .	64.11993
to their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part .	178.43103
even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her .	61.11674

enrique jorda , conductor and musical director of the san francisco symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in europe before returning home to open the symphony ' s golden anniversary season , it was announced .	30.54357
the guest assignments are scheduled for november 14 and 18 , with the orchestra sinfonica siciliana in palermo and the orchestra of radio cologne .	16.205437
the season in san francisco will open with a special gala concert on november 22 .	14.981122
during his five-month visit abroad , jorda recently conducted the orchestre philharmonique de bordeau in france , and the santa cecilia orchestra in rome .	9.44194
in announcing jorda ' s return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the sherman clay box office on wednesday .	42.803524
guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists yehudi menuhin , isaac stern , ruggiero ricci and david abel	16.248434
pianists leon fleisher , ruth slenczynka and stephen bishop and conductor earl bernard murray .	17.343067
the leningrad kirov ballet , which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house , is , i think , the finest `` classical ' ' ballet company i have ever seen , and the production of the petipa-tschaikowsky `` sleeping beauty ' ' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing .	32.427948
i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect	30.351315
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was	74.76273
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people	9.365355
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms .	6.6456704
all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirov ' s utterly captivating presentation .	23.468733
the reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova ' ' , `` eva ' ' , or `` aya ' ' .	9.607184
in other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet .	421.58768
it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- miss omsk , miss pinsk , miss stalingr oops , skip it .	21.731907
these qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company ' s collective personality .	102.15615
it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet .	117.09836
oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the kirov .	29.826036
this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics .	60.17455
but , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned .	79.38641
irina kolpakova , the princess aurora of friday ' s performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before .	55.92834
she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable .	23.303146
alla sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the east , was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner , yuri soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky .	25.857012
vladilen semenov , a fine `` danseur noble ' '	1.4094646
and inna zubkovskaya , an excellent lilac fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent .	28.235954
the production , designed by simon virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way .	156.29436
it was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery .	26.781992
evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , guy lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity .	61.997097
mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the san francisco chamber music society .	34.95497

sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season	15.652719
participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in the chronicle ) .	63.459263
mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 chestnut street , san francisco 9 .	23.438944
san francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children .	48.277794
fire fighters local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for san franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen .	22.699308
toys will not be collected at firehouses this year .	5.3973603
they will be accepted at all branches of the bay view federal savings and loan association , at a collection center in the center of the stonestown mall , and at the junior museum , 16th street and roosevelt way .	46.44657
from the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution .	34.19794
any needy family living in san francisco can obtain toys by writing to christmas toys , 676 howard street , san francisco 5 , and listing the parent ' s name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 .	34.22483
requests must be mailed in by december 5 .	1.6086733
famed cellist pablo casals took his instrument to the east room of the white house yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal .	25.922337
he was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for puerto rico governor luis munoz marin .	26.248062
president kennedy ' s invitation to the spanish-born master said , `` we feel your performance as one of the world ' s greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests ' ' .	45.102215
for a good many seasons i ' ve been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies .	29.141516
after all , this year ' s movies are next year ' s television shows .	30.191902
so i went to see `` la dolce vita ' ' .	1.7056265
it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality .	18.600208
all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film .	24.019396
if that ' s all the romans did , it ' s a surprise to me that rome fell .	39.713455
after television , `` la dolce vita ' ' seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night .	79.15515
i cannot imagine a single scene that isn ' t done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week .	36.89694
`` la dolce vita ' ' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western .	50.537006
week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` the adventures of ozzie and harriet ' ' .	15.483577
there is more decadence on `` 77 sunset strip ' ' .	5.68326
there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series .	1459.1401
in another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns .	43.59934
with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you ' ll find on the robert herridge theater .	24.948229
most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party ' ' at a seaside villa .	22.81981
producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! !	87.372826
the dolce vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip )	35.78254
a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face	84.81809
a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies .	5.941177
put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word i can think of dull .	73.5926
apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall .	12.488062
what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! !	313.79373
as a moral shocker it is a dud .	4.2183976
but this doesn ' t detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film .	125.89572
the chronicle ' s paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly	34.33359
`` this is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories ' ' .	62.50796
and when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing .	29.33609

it is very chic to drive foreign cars .	4.138427
with a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back .	49.010338
the wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive .	13.740963
but we couldn ' t really get along without it .	38.040237

the present crop of small cars is enriching american humor .	432.6294
gas station people are very debonair about small cars .	7.6490426
when i drove a car with tail fins , i had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases .	21.327414
my car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth .	38.06435
when i had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me .	78.07797
check the oil and water , sir ? ?	1.1735445
the man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank .	11.540519
`` what kind of car is it ' ' ? ?	2.939573
`` it is a british austin , the smallest they make ' ' .	77.047005

ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! !	1.2858576
when i wheeled about , finned fore and aft , i was the darling of the doormen .	13.625333

at last the white house is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master american craftsman , duncan phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u . s . presidents of the 19th century sent abroad for their furnishings .	35.378242
the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansion ' s library .	33.48189
the suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 ' s .	30.844078
the gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey , whose famous estate , `` tranquility ' ' , was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover , n . j . .	12.182291
authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago .	173.84132
this acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs .	17.700415
the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedy ' s fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home .	24.309784
it is the aid ' s intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of americana ' ' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall .	54.65871
the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture .	25.683369
the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem , mass . , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in 1792 .	32.308685
the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace .	45.59006
it will be painted to match the paneling in the room .	19.343834
the aid committee ' s chairman in charge of the redecoration , mrs . henry francis lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project .	19.51403
mrs . lenygon ' s committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york , include mrs . allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j . jussel , both wellknown manhattan decorators .	17.796515
regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e . barnes of boston .	33.57138
president kennedy couldn ' t stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people ' s concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the 85-piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard , n . c . .	25.907482
but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music .	94.65183
at 4 p . m . the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert .	57.404858
it was the first in the series of `` concerts for young people by young people ' ' to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house .	27.180998
she was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience .	54.76727
she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port , mass . , and in his welcoming remarks , the president said he was representing her .	20.07776
as he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion , the band struck up the `` star spangled banner ' ' and followed it with `` hail to the chief ' ' .	28.949783
`` i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band , and we are grateful to them ' ' , president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl .	68.18865
after paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , president kennedy said , `` as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music ' ' .	57.32034
he added `` i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field ' ' .	46.207287
displaying his knowledge of music , the new england-born president remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont , by young americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the united states .	64.380005
`` this is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as i do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the white house ' ' .	46.12874
as he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests .	42.872635
he expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde patricia holbrook , 16 , of mount rainier , had attended the joseph p . kennedy school for the handicapped in boston .	35.500336
`` the nuns there do a wonderful work ' ' , the president commented .	16.42276
patricia now attends the c . melvin sharpe health school in the district .	61.377686
each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon .	49.176777
they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff .	18.94561
many of the music-loving members of the president ' s staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience .	31.965199
and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected .	193.48209
henry hall wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the president ' s staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives , turned guest conductor for a sousa march , the `` stars and stripes forever ' ' .	39.564564
transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs . kennedy ' s social secretary , letitia baldrige , told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring .	55.988056
he said he contacted a friend , henry hall wilson , on the president ' s staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series .	45.2996
a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student north carolina group to play the first concert .	45.846714
one of the most interested `` students ' ' on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house , was letitia baldrige , social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy .	36.127453
`` i was an art major in college ' ' , miss baldrige explained .	14.779803
`` i ' ve been here so many times i couldn ' t count them ' ' .	6.9455566
she turned out to be a fan , too , of margaret bouton , the gallery ' s associate curator of education .	26.884947
miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at 5 p . m . .	21.609846
the brevard group of 85 arrived at the gallery at 6 p . m . , remaining for about 45 minutes .	16.232477
the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later .	61.840733
they decided that they thought rembrandt ' s self-portrait made him look `` sad ' '	27.541517
they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphael ' s `` alba madonna ' ' and `` texture ' ' in a monet painting of rheims cathedral .	5.9185886
everybody had heard of van gogh , the french impressionist .	37.69499
gallery director john walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them .	18.917255
he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , richard bales .	52.309994
i ' m sure you ' ve heard of him and his record , ' the confederacy ' ' ' .	49.66771
along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the gallery ' s blue-uniformed guards .	45.96924
in 45 minutes , the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late 19th century .	30.622845
a few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art ' ' .	15.842078
among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were boucher , courbet , fra angelico .	13.234426
the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallery ' s rotunda fountain `` because it ' s on the second floor ' ' .	37.777355
that imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st . nw . took on bustling life yesterday .	22.49416
more than 250 scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , albert pike , who headed the scottish rite from 1859 to 1891 .	35.559906
they came together in the huge , high-ceilinged council chamber to hear the late leader eulogized .	85.97145
c . wheeler barnes of denver , head of the scottish rite in colorado , praised pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the masonic order .	22.840136
the ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of pike in the house of the temple .	20.08082
about 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the ancient and accepted scottish rite for the southern jurisdiction of the united states .	19.242504
the opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a . m . today .	20.03743
there will be a pilgrimage to mount vernon at 2 30 p . m . .	6.3613358
a wreath will be placed at the tomb of george washington , one of this nation ' s first masons -- a past master of washington-alexandria lodge 22 in alexandria .	42.284847
the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years .	113.762695
john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous .	46.043167
he would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife .	50.965294
hurt by his lack of interest and attention , mary complained often that he didn ' t help around the house , and that he didn ' t really care about the family .	38.30053
he in turn told her she demanded too much .	11.204383
they were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable .	19.703732
without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done .	48.844105
the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer .	80.80789
family service , sharing in ugf , has five agencies in the washington area .	81.93644
they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems .	100.50002
because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , mr . and mrs . black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia , the agency nearest them .	56.920284
for nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce .	47.053074
the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other .	86.14894
they are now working together toward solving their difficulties .	51.16982

one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev .	49.757717
`` i ' m hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground ' ' .	103.297516
the president knew that a confrontation with mr . khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable .	132.39487
but he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting .	73.74948
he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u . s . and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy .	24.719244
president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s . khrushchev in vienna june 3 and 4 .	39.062412
the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in east-west relations .	15.08916
the heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the president ' s change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader .	13.548057
he was not going to vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned .	29.439459
but mr . kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr . khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe .	25.07589
that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting .	21.624462
despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war .	29.161823
the u . s . and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations ' ' .	45.100086
the first time was in 1955 when a full-dress big four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of geneva ' ' .	30.132221
the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east .	72.75554
in 1959 president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u . s . .	6.948087
that meeting produced the `` spirit of camp david ' ' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement .	75.55811
on the third occasion -- another big four summit session at paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit ' ' .	49.62395
premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u . s . for the u-2 incident .	7.7239623
the episode tended to confirm the u . s . belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the soviet leader ' s real aims in summitry .	25.178207
thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president , mr . kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem .	27.143295
shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words	48.58865
`` as long as mr . khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations ' ' .	62.91365
the president had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the u . s . and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance .	60.035007
he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary .	71.79578
he wanted time , too , to review the united states ' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating .	67.443474
above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchev ' s doorstep .	33.871418
at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader .	42.26952
ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels .	88.310905
but mr . kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it .	72.733345
it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe mr . khrushchev ' s intentions and to make clear his own views .	32.68341
moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u . s . was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions .	33.760433
both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e . thompson brought back to russia late in february .	73.27081
the letter , dated feb . 22 , was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk , siberia , on march 9 .	17.875391
it dealt mainly with a broad range of east-west issues .	3.7962108
but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr . khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted .	31.614388
developments over the next two months , however , caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing .	22.184866
there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly .	33.142456
the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva .	11.601089
the deadlock has been caused by the russians ' new demand for a three-man ( east , west and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery .	46.01506
in the u . s . , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing .	38.93627
mr . kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament .	59.716007
there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to communist china .	43.054874
the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent .	61.742733
moreover , moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the u . n . secretariat and the international control commission for laos .	21.676115
mr . kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible .	103.898605
developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting .	12.19882
initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting .	27.300316
at the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the west ' s ability and determination to resist communist pressure .	26.523556
in cuba , the u . s . had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep .	28.49603
in laos , the picture was almost equally bad .	70.76332
u . s . willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized ' ' on soviet terms .	33.626945
beyond that , allied disagreement about military intervention in laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-communist forces .	53.68973
as a result , the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos , and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure .	61.730133
in the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself .	53.18127
ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leader ' s mood was cocky and aggressive .	13.1218405
he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out .	90.155754
the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin , iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back .	49.008663
it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the u . s . embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future .	69.96278
mr . kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may 20 after consultation with the allies .	116.12291
the response from london , paris and bonn was favorable .	50.81028
firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week .	49.040348
apparently at the insistence of the u . s . , the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the `` informal ' ' nature of the meeting .	30.16661
`` the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries .	56.217186
the meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries ' ' .	61.66309
the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in mr . kennedy ' s own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident ' ' , and a 44-year-old president ( his birthday is may 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy .	43.899323
the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u . s . of both approval and disapproval .	40.770573
the approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at vienna .	33.573902
the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations .	10.524959
but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary .	104.87274
mr . khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men .	22.754133
the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr . kennedy would give him pause .	48.207012
apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the u . s . appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit .	31.630928
premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway .	159.43231
this time the initiative came , in part at least , from washington .	37.138844
there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr . khrushchev , the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders .	39.009846
thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity .	67.464615
finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the president ' s making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord .	32.797253
there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world .	22.242157
if tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the u . s . make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union .	28.636183
disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse .	37.340904
after cuba and laos , it was argued , mr . khrushchev will interpret the president ' s consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds .	75.58676
moreover , the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of america ' s firm foreign policy commitments .	38.876617
the question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the president would take if mr . khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east .	66.90166
there are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory .	60.96015
the shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development .	27.916155
though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education .	45.708813
there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities .	48.757347
the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that .	94.53816
by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence .	54.746277
there is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture .	41.200172
viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university .	58.68897
but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project	283.1506
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy .	19.15917
official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds .	36.42475
american catholics have responded generously to bishops ' and pastors ' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning .	69.266365
they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made .	41.878593
diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility .	163.5027
all of this may be understandable enough it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise .	54.64839
yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities .	38.39305
community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible .	43.44462
to understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of american catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community .	27.902407
it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment .	13.688174
a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere .	48.21524
the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension .	38.50183
the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship .	16.8298
american catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise ' ' -- the `` private enterprise ' ' of religious communities .	18.92699
had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees .	53.92102
there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business ' ' .	55.935406
this `` family-community ' ' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement .	25.331768
it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas .	21.801708
i think for example of three women ' s colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university , which is also co-educational .	25.928406
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough .	517.24817
it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot .	73.58077
apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business ' ' spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny .	26.444572
for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today ' s need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence ' ' .	50.900898
at the earlier `` pre-academic excellence ' ' stage of catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis .	89.84602
but with today ' s demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders ' ' becomes more pressing .	24.714151
the problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers ' ' are needed but that a different brand is called for .	58.85204
commenting on the earlier stage , the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee ' ' ( as opposed to , e . g . , `` maintenance employee ' ' ) was a not inapt description .	30.289175
today however , the `` outsider ' ' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university .	52.66278
and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement .	55.82773
in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it `` even with the best of intentions he ( the president of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities .	52.740993
it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' ' ' .	56.264034
the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns ' ' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside ' ' faculty .	38.978912
it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university ' ' this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension .	60.879253
but in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one .	62.497948
`` outside ' ' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business .	53.704685
there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university .	25.547459
in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel .	24.030886
word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences .	84.1413
expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype .	87.27431
in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere .	82.97466
to appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service .	94.27662
much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure .	171.3366
this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated .	9.936988
when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services .	54.582138
a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family ' ' .	26.47138
just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions .	68.15647
yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place .	70.984406
broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university .	69.78662
religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman ' s reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification .	44.169632
there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels .	76.0149
the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution .	59.00189
but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation .	66.54716
the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group ' ' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself .	31.722265
this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure .	47.874386
yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order .	51.635296
the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority .	51.43301
in the case of academic personnel the `` feeling ' ' of participation can hardly be `` faked ' ' .	8.670306
competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students ' illusion that they are making their own decisions .	55.770473
those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work ' ' and ersatz decision making .	75.87695
in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all .	171.0751
in the notre dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication ' ' .	28.501766
in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation ' ' the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i . e . , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements .	40.04208
sen . john l . mcclellan of arkansas and rep . david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws .	51.369785
once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally .	53.967224
or , in the words of anatole france , `` the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges ' ' .	37.868595
the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr . mcclellan ' s hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites .	39.018726
the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program .	162.60825
in addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill .	47.952953
it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike .	36.17474
business week ( aug . 9 , 1961 ) reports that the united aircraft company , against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating .	93.9208
the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers .	51.325165
the company has billed the united states government for $7 , 500 , 000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor ' s business .	44.08145
rep . frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee .	36.83483
neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter	113.231186
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions .	8.459198
the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained .	33.182957
the anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines	209.67758
it must play a game in which there never is a winner .	71.7006
the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law .	74.37747
hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy .	42.84534
let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which general electric , westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market .	33.600155
the industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied .	108.897
the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment .	27.894146
accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price .	58.213146
naturally , enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time .	63.42342
should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry .	49.685463
uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition ' ' .	12.231627
but if they show self-restraint , they don ' t get the orders .	27.028837
under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted .	85.4251
engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants .	31.30993
the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that general electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows .	43.698143
in other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday , wednesday and friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday , thursday and saturday .	72.179924
and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday ? ?	35.25055
the question might be asked `` don ' t the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ?	18.028648
why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws ' ' ? ?	47.40205
the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold , in the folklore of capitalism , back in 1937 .	61.621082
he wrote `` ( p . 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure .	39.195145
( p . 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship .	27.65342
( p . 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control .	47.460228
in this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws .	68.12778
( pp . 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government ' ' .	47.843098
this escape from control has led to management ' s evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while .	92.886765
a plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license .	35.17079
( the penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities .	35.22176
if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest .	45.91733
a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle .	28.633717
however , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational .	43.880215
quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union .	58.927265
those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform .	36.451126
before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english .	77.12011
the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial recovery act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle .	39.599354
the wagner act , the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining .	10.972707
the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .	82.03465
if a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud .	13.041977
the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession .	33.479942
if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them .	61.30947
human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century america .	42.990337
as early as 1776 , adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations `` we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work	65.30188
but many against combining to raise it ' ' .	1.4575676
eighteenth-century england , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies .	36.087933
in 1825 , the boston house carpenters ' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared `` it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies ' ' .	49.147682
there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly .	125.51379
the courts shared the opinion of the employers .	8.370506
in people vs . fisher , justice savage of the new york supreme court declared	21.649763
`` without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it	34.35499
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means ' ' .	34.643116
compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin , according to the daily labor report of sept . 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment ' ' .	32.19262
senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation .	27.324242
his bill , allegedly aimed at hoffa , would amend the sherman , clayton and norris-laguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international .	58.79151
paradoxically , the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act .	62.140285
indeed , it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws	90.47461
for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers .	45.16745
at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates .	47.212406
the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies .	39.339565
in the famous danbury hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices , e . g . , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer .	17.935102
the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment .	94.98279
in 1914 , the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity .	50.1083
labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws .	60.63627
the courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act .	306.89984
in 1922 , the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company .	10.560352
the company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union ' s activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce .	18.338392
( what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ?	54.58093
) the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce .	252.94502
at a closed-door session on capitol hill last week , secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on u . s . affairs abroad .	31.163479
afterward , tennessee ' s democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen .	99.291084
what herter presented , said gore , was `` not a very encouraging review ' ' .	17.034922
that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts .	66.8595
while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos , two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions .	40.282166
hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery , dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the u . s . with a blunt and drastic demand within 48 hours , the u . s . had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 u . s . citizens , plus 120 cuban employees ) .	36.513466
president eisenhower held an 8 30 a . m . meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately .	41.216167
`` there is a limit to what the united states in self-respect can endure ' ' , said the president .	38.012432
`` that limit has now been reached ' ' .	1.2263901
through secretary herter , ike offered president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision .	54.109303
kennedy , through secretary-designate of state dean rusk , declined .	47.33658
he thus kept his hands free for any action after jan . 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the u . s . and latin america ( see the hemisphere ) .	52.82637
after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants , the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam .	31.047543
`` in view of the present situation in laos ' ' , said the pentagon ' s announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific ' ' .	19.93404
cutting short a holiday at hong kong , the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines .	23.563778
on the u . s . ' s island base of okinawa , task force 116 , made up of army , navy , marine and air force units , got braced to move southward on signal .	44.161434
but by week ' s end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the u . s . was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-western -- government might be best for laos .	33.737213
there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts .	36.919483
political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right .	79.34739
`` it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again ' ' , said one military man .	89.74031
but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground ? ?	6.310194
at geneva in 1954 , to get the war in indo-china settled , the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state , north viet nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos .	48.542297
the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west .	56.49187
he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj .	39.61328
`` the important thing from now on ' ' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia ' ' .	31.393696
russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana , russian intrigue in the congo , and russian arms drops in laos ( using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time .	40.10401
soviet premier khrushchev sent new year ' s hopes for peace to president-elect kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply .	40.8308
considering the state of the whole world , the cold war ' s three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous	35.810925
but , in senator gore ' s words , it was `` not a very encouraging ' ' situation that would confront john f . kennedy on inauguration day .	26.469183
as the 87th congress began its sessions last week , liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor .	45.90438
the liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost .	162.5625
this time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable .	49.52638
they had the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck .	33.566574
and counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will .	68.30814
there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely mississippi ' s 14-term william meyers colmer ( pronounced calmer ) .	44.716373
caucusing , the liberals decided to go after colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the house is next to godliness .	32.07481
a dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative .	22.465347
he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents .	85.90547
he is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-negro ' ' speech .	23.49158
for 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee .	50.05329
there his vote , along with those of chairman howard smith , the courtly virginia judge , and the four republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the rayburn-johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) .	45.899532
there was sufficient pretext to demand colmer ' s ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi .	14.285238
reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons .	52.149517
in 1949 the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry truman , and in 1957 , after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage .	46.63632
( in the heat of the anti-colmer drive last week , judge smith threatened reprisal against powell .	39.057346
said he `` we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here ' ' .	39.73376
) but speaker sam rayburn , after huddling in palm beach with president-elect kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective .	49.906796
in a tense , closed-door session with judge smith , rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the rules committee ( two democrats , including one southerner , and one republican ) .	65.66966
smith flatly rejected the offer , and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels .	27.205675
the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man ' ' .	53.893147
news of rayburn ' s commitment soon leaked out .	9.279716
when missouri ' s clarence cannon got the word , he turned purple .	56.44504
he shouted , and rushed off to the speaker ' s room to object `` a dangerous precedent ' ' ! !	44.440006
cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the smith-colmer forces as chairman of the appropriations committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects .	73.03229
sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally , georgia ' s carl vinson , chairman of the armed services committee .	26.2492
as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that judge smith could lose .	57.14682
his highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus .	110.49669
the liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the democratic committee on committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the house -- before they could oust colmer .	35.974957
( one big question if colmer was to be purged , what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ?	38.189777
) in all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash .	80.48632
but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war .	14.307076
if the southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party .	63.733498
with that possibility in mind , arkansas ' wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees , and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise .	41.559708
`` here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone ' ' , said a house democratic leader .	53.024063
`` one wants a little more power , and the other doesn ' t want to give up any ' ' .	19.913143
the senate launched the 87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the house ' s guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guide ' s speech .	37.279446
question at issue how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ?	55.960217
a wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from minnesota ' s democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts ' republican leverett saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills .	50.734474
new mexico ' s clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senate ' s notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds .	65.50057
fair dealer humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators .	13.597503
georgia ' s dick russell objected politely , and the battle was joined .	54.775185
privately , the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage .	62.220993
privately , they also admitted that their hopes for clint anderson ' s three-fifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon .	46.91293
in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress , and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding .	53.251938
armed with the nixon opinion , the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week .	29.16712
hopefully , the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all .	108.54105
since election day , vice president richard nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view .	261.42697
but with the convening of the new congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the senate until john kennedy ' s inauguration .	44.182503
one day last week , nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration ' ' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election .	31.099255
nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration ' ' .	44.029636
`` this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated ' ' , he said .	25.298988
the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves .	42.939438
gary player , the small , trim south african , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap .	52.152885
arnold palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief .	37.730232
`` just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you ' ' , player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament .	62.71728
and that is just what happened on the last few holes .	171.63121
the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer .	157.19461
player was the first to feel its teeth .	1.8017663
after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( sunday ' s fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , player ' s game rapidly fell to pieces .	66.28524
after a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th .	9.612505
he bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .	19.33891
as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , player was almost in tears .	38.60685
he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke .	66.08239
palmer had started the round four strokes behind player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes .	48.50138
now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf .	48.73518
when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won .	9.121626
but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression .	11.008543
in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower .	67.598114
afterwards , palmer told charlie coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast .	71.276436
he did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out , giving palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost .	29.332544
when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet .	28.966938
palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts ' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt .	41.413773
palmer ' s 281 for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe .	39.506584
the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 .	26.707369
until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place .	99.28105
as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69 .	61.32111
his three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by bill collins , the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long .	67.90607
but palmer knew , as did everybody else at augusta , that his streak was about to be broken .	22.74854
half an hour after he finished his round , player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of palmer .	13.620364
long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player .	40.495358
unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case .	50.20085
when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmer ' s towering prestige .	54.555336
as if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments .	40.316967
but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago , player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere .	29.52277
on the final round at pensacola , the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come .	26.664492
on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it .	55.079975
but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour .	60.956112
player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer .	21.495205
he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmer ' s 71 .	28.232265
thereafter , until the masters , player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami .	89.4466
when they reached augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date .	75.389404
on thursday , the first day of the masters , the contest between palmer and player developed instantly .	31.181293
it was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course .	109.06907
the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences .	50.84192
palmer ' s 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with bob rosburg .	51.349693
but player was only one stroke back , with a 69 .	19.473372
even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between palmer and player .	39.852024
a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70	58.00041
or ken venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better	42.04259
or rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augusta ' s treacheries	14.798855
or even old byron nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf .	104.100494
( on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe .	19.870426
on friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus .	95.63267
rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time palmer and player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day .	46.505543
as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender .	37.946358
player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th .	24.332472
on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament .	24.47561
he birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 .	19.512362
starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle , palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 .	19.096668
the roar of palmer ' s gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of player ' s gallery for a similar triumph .	34.757004
at one point late in the day , when palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole .	18.743738
without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply .	35.96145
anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course .	70.21026
it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence .	74.11672
the bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions .	20.470627
and last week at the masters palmer and player did .	21.178822
as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was player ' s superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead .	32.8876
as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day .	51.82064
in fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes .	51.16777
but player ' s real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards .	12.6910515
he hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways .	22.368938
having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out .	76.51609
player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling .	19.581375
the latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green .	25.419554
`` i was hitting the ball well ' ' , player said later , `` and i felt strong .	32.193817
when you ' re playing like that you ' d better attack ' ' .	33.55074
player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget .	117.8052
it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge .	24.905928
from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 .	40.574665
palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles .	5.5842886
they started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 .	5.379364
on this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days .	44.189365
at the 4th tee palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green .	33.964973
his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par .	82.25678
starting the second nine , palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it .	60.24788
when mickey charles mantle , the new york yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime .	51.979782
when roger eugene maris , mantle ' s muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe .	31.51372
but when tiny , 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there ' ' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous .	63.480724
this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .	9.443773
it is the year when ( 1 ) amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs	31.180424
( 2 ) willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammate ' s bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game	24.237967
( 3 ) the milwaukee braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them	24.27035
and ( 4 ) catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter .	22.122654
pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal .	12.630945
experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion .	68.98766
whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division .	96.30986
of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy .	65.29416
this , of course , is baseball ' s most remarkable mark the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , george herman ( babe ) ruth of the yankees .	22.59271
since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruth ' s record and each , in turn , has been thwarted .	56.574677
what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruth ' s amazing september surge .	22.5404
in the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched .	38.764885
always , in the abortive attacks upon ruth ' s record , one man alone -- a jimmy foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a hank greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a hack wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid .	19.45463
but now , for the first time since lou gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 .	61.11936
their names are mantle and maris , their team is the yankees , and their threat is real .	38.384632
after 108 games in 1927 , ruth had 35 home runs .	15.386368
after 108 games in 1961 , mickey mantle has 43 , roger maris 41 .	24.69591
extend mantle ' s and maris ' s present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs .	46.182056
this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them .	150.75938
to better ruth ' s mark , neither needs a spectacular september flourish .	118.56888
all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september , and he will establish a new record .	40.515457
in ruth ' s day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games .	69.63167
baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruth ' s record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games .	44.71217
`` even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation ' ' , insists hank greenberg , now vice-president of the chicago white sox .	19.609789
`` it has to be easier with two of them .	14.330458
how can you walk maris to get to mantle ' ' ? ?	9.839697
neither mantle nor maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself .	37.971832
although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player ' s standard quote `` the important thing is to win the pennant ' ' .	50.509857
but one thing is for certain there is no dissension between mantle , the american league ' s most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 , and maris , the mvp in 1960 .	33.069874
each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` i hope roger hits 80 ' ' , mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and i hope i hit 81 ' ' ) .	44.90742
the sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( mantle ' s in dallas , maris ' s in kansas city ) , they are rooming together .	58.58275
mantle , maris , and bob cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in jamaica , long island , not far from new york international airport .	28.160872
the three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture .	36.799793
mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom	6.210885
maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room .	10.918167
they divide up the household chores cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible ) , and maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium .	37.120758
mantle , maris , and cerv probably share one major-league record already among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for cerv , four for mantle , and three for maris .	91.64037
as roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , mantle , 29 , who broke in with the yankees ten years ago , and maris , 26 , who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds .	26.910044
both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( mantle in commerce , okla . , maris in fargo , n . d . )	19.839478
as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma ( `` sometimes in the minors ' ' , maris recalls , `` i wished i had gone to oklahoma ' ' ) .	22.361229
to an extent , the two even look alike .	12.764454
both have blue eyes and short blond hair .	2.3607848
both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger .	32.94517
with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order .	291.21262
maris purchases $100 suits from simpson ' s in new york .	17.343327
mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and pays as much as $250 each .	140.38261
neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , henry miller ' s `` tropic of cancer ' ' .	24.932608
mantle so appreciated miller ' s delicate literary style that he broadened teammates ' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips .	51.584366
mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking .	53.73577
`` what do you and mickey talk about at home ' ' ? ?	18.391176
`` to tell you the truth ' ' , maris said , `` mickey don ' t talk much ' ' .	15.86684
this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer .	9.221272
what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative .	36.62793
of the two , mantle is by nature the less outgoing , maris the more outspoken .	211.71718
but last week , when a reporter was standing near mantle ' s locker , mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote .	47.881584
he said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy .	7.495034
`` that ' s ( yogi ) berra ' s .	9.932969
i ' ll never forget one time i struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game .	44.164032
i came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says ' you stunk ' ' ' .	68.85329
maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen .	32.003296
`` when i ' ve made a dumb play ' ' , he says , `` i don ' t want to talk to anyone .	8.12441
by his own confession , maris is an angry young man .	18.845778
benched at tulsa in 1955 , he told manager dutch meyer `` i can ' t play for you .	28.295097
send me where i can play ' ' .	1.4897852
( meyer sent him to reading , pa . .	3.3291833
) benched at indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager kerby farrell `` i ' m not learning anything on the bench .	34.307228
( farrell did -- and maris led the team to victory in the little world series .	35.90263
) `` that ' s the way i am ' ' , he says .	8.762934
if you ' re a good ballplayer , you ' ve got to get mad .	14.820987
give me a team of nine angry men and i ' ll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we ' ll beat you nine out of ten times ' ' .	32.34605
one good indication of the two men ' s personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes .	44.46141
`` when i was a kid ' ' , maris told a sportswriter last week , `` i used to follow williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not ' ' .	45.128204
`` when you came up to the majors , did you seek out williams for advice ' ' ? ?	93.65126
`` you ' re afraid to talk to a guy you idolize ' ' .	9.945144
`` when mickey went to the yankees ' ' , says mark freeman , an ex-yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver , `` dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his .	77.270805
he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him ' ' .	31.708157
among all the yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies .	66.34039
neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else .	97.480446
if laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the yankees , maris would lay ties on a railroad track .	49.445984
if working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the yankees , mantle would work in a zinc mine .	46.09391
but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , mantle and maris concentrate on baseball .	57.306374
they try to play baseball the best they can .	90.91538
mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well .	78.1043
( `` one of the reasons they get along fine ' ' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize mantle is head-and-shoulders above maris ' ' .	54.633617
) hitting , mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , maris only left-handed .	35.791397
they both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings .	50.689365
both are good bunters maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues	66.74221
mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base .	35.576443
both have brilliant speed mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3 . 1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer	44.210144
maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the white sox .	19.424513
both are good , daring fielders mantle covers more ground	2621.5525
yet with all their skills , the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one basic the home run .	219.7748
with this ultimate weapon , the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season .	42.87431
( american league expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams .	23.903067
only two teams in each league ( the yankees and detroit , the dodgers and cincinnati ) are battling for first place .	47.930824
appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball ' s lowest moment .	66.62234
in 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball .	28.155146
into washington on president-elect john f . kennedy ' s convair , the caroline , winged actor-crooner frank sinatra and his close hollywood pal , cinemactor peter lawford , jack kennedy ' s brother-in-law .	19.972448
also included in the entourage a dog in a black sweater , frankie and peter had an urgent mission to stage a mammoth inauguration eve entertainment gala in the capital ' s national guard armory .	35.478317
frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival `` it ' s really tremendous when you think ella fitzgerald is coming from australia .	27.73987
i could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans ' ' ! !	46.63765
as the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory ' s $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10 , 000 each .	13.866126
the biggest single act would doubtless be staged by frankie himself his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by hollywood couturier don loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles .	24.942135
soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered `` two of everything ' ' just `` in case he spills anything ' ' , frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of loper clothing .	33.69212
a year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the marine corps , general david m . shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless new year ' ' greeting to his pentagon staff .	51.514744
said leatherneck shoup `` a year ago i took the grips of the plow in my hands .	28.043335
after pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , i lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team i ever held a rein on .	60.642918
little geeing and hawing have been necessary ' ' .	1.322979
but shoup also gave the corps a tilling in spots .	35.925884
speaking of `` pride ' ' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940	53.2736
the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window .	211.31859
a few of these people are still around ' ' .	6.951456
old and new briefly crossed paths in the u . s . senate , then went their respective ways .	28.196434
at a reception for new members of congress , oregon democrat maurine neuberger , taking the senate seat held by her husband richard until his death last march , got a brotherly buss from democratic elder statesman adlai stevenson , u . s . ambassador-designate to the u . n . .	27.258673
meanwhile , after 24 years in the senate , rhode island ' s durable democrat theodore francis greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last november ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the senate .	58.21131
the most famous undergraduate of south philadelphia high school is a current bobby-sox idol , dreamboat cacophonist fabian ( real name fabian forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while .	39.380066
the principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in hollywood and philadelphia -- fabian is a 10-o ' clock scholar in english and mathematics .	27.975933
lacking his needed credits in those subjects , fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week .	75.42877
south philadelphia high ' s principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure ' ' of a movie that the toneless lad was making .	21.038504
to decathlon man rafer johnson ( time cover , aug . 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer ' s olympic games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the a . a . u . ' s james e . sullivan memorial trophy as the outstanding u . s . amateur athlete of 1960 .	36.285305
as the world ' s top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- sports illustrated tapped golf ' s confident arnold palmer ( time cover , may 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the masters and u . s . open crowns , went on to win a record $80 , 738 for the year .	28.014565
tooling through sydney on his way to race in the new zealand grand prix , britain ' s balding ace driver stirling moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination .	21.73261
`` i ' m a slob ' ' , he announced .	20.666325
i ' m useless for anything but racing cars .	16.223757
i ' m ruddy lazy , and i ' m getting on in years .	37.624275
it gets so frustrating , but then again i don ' t know what i could do if i gave up racing ' ' .	26.38748
one of nikita khrushchev ' s most enthusiastic eulogizers , the u . s . s . r . ' s daily izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed red-prone comedian charlie chaplin at his swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 .	9.853984
chaplin , 71 , who met k . when the soviet boss visited england in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit russia some time this summer because `` i have marveled at your grandiose experiment and i believe in your future ' ' .	65.55409
then charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the nikita he had glimpsed `` i was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face ' ' .	55.122746
g . david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe ' s best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh .	39.637768
there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art .	31.652782
last week , in the german city of dusseldorf , g . david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause .	54.106323
on display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale .	77.26046
like philadelphia ' s late dr . albert c . barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( time , jan . 2 ) , thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime .	46.123447
he made his fortune during world war 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom .	41.095448
even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings .	94.368866
he gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best .	25.981403
he was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the museum of modern art ' s alfred barr said of him `` i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didn ' t know about ' ' .	33.38426
he might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting .	50.58443
he could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough .	38.502373
he bought up cezannes , braques , matisses , legers , a splendid picasso series , more than 70 giacometti sculptures .	18.940248
he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world .	14.031091
all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stone ' s throw , outside pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them .	95.74906
two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city .	32.858223
but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum .	36.664913
pittsburgh turned him down , just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years .	80.45616
he went then to a 40-year-old basel art dealer named ernst beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures .	38.388355
last year beyeler arranged to sell $1 , 500 , 000 worth of klees to the state of north rhine-westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built .	30.41715
last week most of the other prizes , once offered to pittsburgh , went on the block .	108.47395
at the opening of the dusseldorf show , thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time .	45.46325
in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them .	14.017408
some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town .	26.129585
thompson himself said `` i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures ' ' .	112.69179
the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color .	24.565899
but in all its 175 years , not a single negro student has entered its classrooms .	66.85098
last week federal district judge william a . bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified ' ' negro boy and girl .	62.589413
their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in georgia -- and in alabama , mississippi and south carolina as well .	38.52863
for 18 months , hamilton holmes , 19 , and charlayne hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university .	19.32921
they graduated together from atlanta ' s turner high school , where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third .	24.780535
the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins .	31.145979
holmes went to atlanta ' s morehouse ( negro ) college , where he is a b student and star halfback .	79.80451
charlayne studied journalism at detroit ' s wayne state university .	33.12157
last fall , after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court , judge bootle ordered them to apply again .	70.257645
charlayne was `` tentatively ' ' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state .	132.99097
but holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview ' ' .	23.33728
the evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation .	157.73651
holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse ' ' .	14.201959
no , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive ' ' .	15.216856
they also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested ' ' .	12.621326
their reason holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended .	72.996086
negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes .	105.05643
the real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school .	70.48646
judge bootle ' s decision `` the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color ' ' .	125.248085

`` surprised and pleased ' ' , students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week .	47.615402
when the university of chicago ' s chancellor lawrence a . kimpton submitted his resignation last march , a mighty talent hunt gripped the midway .	20.278542
out went letters to 60 , 000 old grads , asking for suggestions .	20.030027
such academic statesmen as james b . conant were consulted .	69.1179
two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors , including adlai stevenson , richard nixon , and harvard ' s dean mcgeorge bundy .	10.575582
the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as trustee chairman glen a . lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right ' ' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago .	89.64314
last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltech ' s acting dean of the faculty dynamic geneticist george wells beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( time , cover , july 14 , 1958 ) .	22.47948
it fell to chancellor kimpton , now a standard oil ( indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up chicago after the 21-year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins .	23.10982
he threw out some of hutchins ' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2 , 100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139 . 3 million .	27.022102
but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era .	64.78505
at caltech , geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school ' s famous biology division since 1946 .	46.797276
but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making .	55.310688
beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters	308.04974
he avidly reads the wall street journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model a ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 .	99.40142
a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end .	82.68266
but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away .	96.669655
the man was king leopold 2 , of the belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good .	41.165813
by force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900 , 000 square miles of wilderness in central africa .	15.272484
this is an area nearly as large as western europe	416.37396
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity .	46.099617
its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings	9.357745
they were determined by the points at which leopold ' s explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .	16.18092
the population of the congo is 13 . 5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters ' ' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects .	41.83203
the religions of the people include christianity , mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism .	5.440391
the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate .	18.537117
the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars .	247.09592
to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case	149.55899
it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done , or failed to do , in the congo since 1885 .	42.167828
at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property .	45.757717
but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience .	56.7843
the belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism .	22.96029
one definition of paternalism is `` the principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children ' ' .	36.230022
the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment .	60.005013
ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant .	106.717285
the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil .	13.87097
the colony was administered from brussels , with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote .	53.36807
the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock .	43.58559
in inside africa , john gunther describes one of these , the societe generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the house of morgan , anaconda copper , the mutual life insurance company of new york , the pennsylvania railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the united states government as a heavy partner ' ' .	40.559322
had they been truly ruthless , the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion .	29.78371
they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes	113.029
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent	38.128574
they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food .	31.574276
but instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often .	67.09929
would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ?	49.764442
the belgians also placed great emphasis on education .	11.054649
during the 1950s there were as many as 25 , 000 schools in the congo .	24.86998
the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte ' ' and `` le chien ' ' and write his name .	19.194283
some schools were technical -- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .	46.945446
but they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .	52.685986
it was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together ' ' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .	64.92756
indeed , the belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .	31.501783
when the congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13 . 5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .	110.67503
why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ?	23.310493
in one large oversimplification , it might be said that the belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping africa .	52.473026
they lacked time to prepare the congo , as the british and french had prepared their colonies .	48.22069
the congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant	104.79186
and in brussels , street crowds shouted , `` pas une goutte de sang ! !	6.617863
' ' ( not one drop of blood ! !	32.56922
the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue	16.188179
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess .	34.79532
it is hard to blame them for this .	15.046185
yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless .	106.17626
as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate .	157.17873
first , there were those congolese ( among them joseph kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , balkanizing it .	34.33365
second , there were those ( moise tshombe ) who favored near-balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states .	44.36648
third , there were those ( notably patrice lumumba ) who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government .	19.765419
and fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up .	53.968456
however , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting .	135.168
a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration .	38.85747
they had divided the congo into six provinces -- leopoldville , kasai , kivu , katanga , equator and eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings .	30.363033
thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war .	86.76426
the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable western-style form of government there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces .	42.7475
well-wishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations .	47.822052
if internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25 , 000-man congolese army , the force publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians .	26.171957
the president , joseph kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , patrice lumumba , a reasonable man .	31.468191
twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other .	329.34058
presently the well-armed members of the force publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting .	14.692357
terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country .	38.803223
the belgian government decided to act , and on july 10 dispatched paratroops to the congo .	25.978163
on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of katanga , moise tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country .	13.581459
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence .	6.9492254
lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians , and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them .	27.446434
on july 14 the security council -- with france and great britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the u . n . into the congo .	27.26585
vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretary-general `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( congolese ) government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the government , to meet fully their tasks .	42.334602
secretary-general hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the u . n . troops sent into the congo were to come from african , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the u . s . , russia , great britain or france .	29.76226
he quickly called on ghana , tunisia , morocco , guinea and mali , which dispatched troops within hours .	18.224026
ultimately the u . n . army in the congo reached a top strength of 19 , 000 , including about 5 , 000 from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden , who were the only whites .	31.711618
it took the u . n . three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo .	35.21631
the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed u . n . efforts .	30.354132
the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the u . n . to get out of the congo along with the belgians , and appealed to russia for help .	37.79112
( however , there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist .	61.483902
before appealing to the u . n . or to russia , he first appealed to the u . s . for military help , and was rejected .	42.785473
) lumumba further complicated the u . n . ' s mission by initiating small `` wars ' ' with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which , under albert kalonji , wanted to secede as well .	34.2819
meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo , sending lumumba equipment for his `` wars ' ' , dispatching `` technicians ' ' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly .	21.083933
but by the end of the three-month period , in october 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the congo .	27.618063
president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him .	7.3289914
control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of joseph mobutu , chief of staff of the congolese army .	64.056786
mobutu promptly flung out the russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at u . n . headquarters in new york .	31.768866
the belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops .	17.208704
but they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers ' ' or `` mercenaries ' ' , who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga , the seceded province which , according to tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country .	16.192015
from october 1960 to february 1961 , the u . n . forces in the congo took little action .	26.253828
there was no directive for it -- the security council ' s resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or balkanize it .	37.061836
during the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo .	13.748444
in february the murder of patrice lumumba , who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe , again stirred the u . n . to action .	26.358862
on feb . 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort ' ' .	28.948519
although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one .	82.298645
it also urged that the u . n . eject , and prevent the return of , all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers	82.145424
urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army .	9.72146
though president john f . kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloy ' s unexpected report from khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of u . s . foreign policy last week .	31.072838
high up on the president ' s priority list was the thorny question of bizerte .	23.571571
on this issue , the president received a detailed report from his u . n . ambassador adlai stevenson , who had just returned from paris , and mr . kennedy asked stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both paris and tunis -- out of the imbroglio .	32.144516
ideally , the president would like the french to agree on a `` status quo ante ' ' on bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base .	20.77012
to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , mr . kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend .	24.241884
the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no . 2 man in the tunisian government , defense minister bahi ladgham , who flew to washington last week to seek u . s . support .	27.07803
the conversation apparently convinced mr . kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable .	28.803448
through ladgham , mr . kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba	40.715496
and one u . s . official said `` the key question now is which side picks up the phone first ' ' .	119.511765
on the latin american front , the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the inter-american economic and social council ( which the president himself had originally hoped to attend ) .	46.739235
main purpose of the meeting to discuss president kennedy ' s alliance for progress .	21.909336
in conferences with nationalist china ' s dapper , diminutive vice president chen cheng , mr . kennedy assured chiang kai-shek ' s emissary that the u . s . is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations .	18.216908
chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia	23.934114
however the president , who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow , would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the u . s . if outer mongolia ' s admission comes to a vote .	30.829494
the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid .	83.5925
to africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , attorney general robert kennedy , on a good-will mission to the ivory coast .	26.122416
all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs	194.6253
in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared `` we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason ' ' .	57.116802
from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston , as the great four-jet boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at phoenix , el paso , and san antonio .	20.920809
when continental airlines night-coach flight 54 took off at 11 30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer .	33.771236
the plane put down on schedule at 1 35 a . m . in phoenix .	12.870828
thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for el paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard .	51.69153
at 3 57 a . m . , with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso , passenger robert berry , a san antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit .	25.692225
`` the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach ' ' , berry said .	16.530844
`` i figured he was sick ' ' .	2.1986692
john salvador , a farmer from palm desert , calif . , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit .	29.804956
`` the kid had a automatic , like they issue in the army ' ' , he said .	24.895164
`` the other fellow had a ' ' .	6.2236285
salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess lois carnegey	13.094015
the man put his at the head of capt . byron d . rickards .	10.762931
to rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story his plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when peruvian rebels made him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa .	39.48475
but last week ' s pirates , like the cuban-american who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra ( newsweek , aug . 7 ) , wanted to go to havana .	14.401085
`` tell your company there are four of us here with guns ' ' , the elder man told rickards .	47.433704
the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message .	198.35704
but , he told the `` skyjackers ' ' , the 707 didn ' t carry enough fuel to reach havana	30.52558
they would have to refuel at el paso .	4.365921
most passengers didn ' t know what had happened until they got on the ground .	27.635893
jerry mccauley of sacramento , calif . , one of some twenty air force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion .	76.06747
`` the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba ' ' , mccauley said , `` and like a nut i raised my hand .	30.044588
i thought he was the air force recruiter ' ' .	5.256773
what the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew .	49.589825
they chose four jack casey , who works for continental airlines in houston	36.402187
pfc . truman cleveland of st . augustine .	5.8995404
fla . , and leonard gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the u . s . immigration service border patrol .	10.542068
everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at el paso at 4 18 a . m . .	38.986023
they found a large welcoming group -- el paso policemen , border patrol , sheriff ' s deputies , and fbi men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns .	10.054299
other fbi men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to havana .	16.54855
the ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours .	103.1777
still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propeller-driven douglas aj .	46.974857
actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane	42.519722
they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of cuba ' s fidel castro who had taken over the 707 .	70.50343
mr . kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone .	39.204323
at one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a cuban plot , the president talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with cuba .	29.266972
as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment .	39.823265
from the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being cubans , were native americans , subsequently identified as leon bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from coolidge , ariz . , and his son , cody , 16 , a high-school junior .	30.745998
the heat and strain began to tell on the beardens .	9.685007
the father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business ' ' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of second officer norman simmons .	69.69843
at 7 30 a . m . , more than three hours after landing , the beardens gave an ultimatum	34.961407
the tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a . m . , and captain rickards began taxiing toward the runway .	12.57481
several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet .	22.659193
the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines	4.658586
ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it .	51.711422
at 12 50 p . m . a ramp was rolled up to the plane .	22.653343
a few minutes later , fbi agent francis crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed .	16.566792
while crosby distracted the beardens , stewardesses carnegey and toni besset dropped out of a rear door .	25.677584
so did hostages casey , cleveland , and mullen .	5.520083
that left only the four crew members , crosby , and border patrolman gilman , all unarmed , with the beardens .	29.4555
the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket .	45.611557
gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance .	74.20952
he caught officer simmons ' eye , nodded toward young bearden , and -- `` i swung my right as hard as i could .	56.001728
simmons and crosby jumped the boy and it was all over ' ' .	50.101036
frog-marched off the airplane at 1 48 p . m . , the beardens were held in bail of $100 , 000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines .	30.096653
( bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to castro , and live high in cuba .	57.174404
) back home in coolidge , ariz . , his 36-year-old wife , mary , said `` i thought they were going to phoenix to look for jobs ' ' .	34.91156
taking precedence over all other legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation .	31.63056
the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in u . s . history .	33.7242
with the money all but in hand , however , the administration indicated that , instead of the 225 , 000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160 , 000 .	47.080154
the `` hold-back ' ' , as pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently .	34.799034
in all , the senate signed a check for $46 . 7 billion , which not only included the extra $3 . 5 billion requested the week before by president kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the president had asked for .	32.165405
( the senate , on its own , decided to provide additional b-52 and other long-range bombers for the strategic air command .	19.133095
) the house , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the president ' s urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order .	74.10679
in other areas , congressional action last week included	2055.3088
the senate ( by voice vote ) and the house ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign , not too unhappily .	72.33383
the senate also voted $5 . 2 billion to finance the government ' s health , welfare , and labor activities .	16.164482
debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend .	26.362898
white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact .	76.697784
most members of the u . s . senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can .	90.117325
but , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter .	36.394867
as a result , ever since 1851 when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it .	70.40739
over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-american course .	27.78176
individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from michigan , soft-shell crabs from maryland , oysters from washington , grapefruit from florida .	20.59791
but plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late sen . fred dubois of idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the senate ' s stomach was in the right place .	23.694893
in a daring stroke , the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10 , 000-per-year french-born maitre d ' hotel .	34.004726
holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes .	91.580086
long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward .	30.747215
higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues .	7.527034
result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative .	67.64129
things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds .	51.464413
traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing .	70.81662
that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates .	26.36662
as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments .	49.698708
another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds .	21.859293
other tax-exempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february 21 , according to standard & poor ' s average .	90.032585
on balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then .	85.93546
however , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend .	56.60652
on these bonds , price rises since february 21 easily outnumber price declines .	64.74299
investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds .	47.55035
you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page .	74.30338
many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that .	58.14546
and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds .	136.30553
that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds .	246.35039
it ' s not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on u . s . treasury bonds .	30.926655
for investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high .	38.09908
it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16 , 000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32 , 000 of taxed income .	23.255491
a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in february or march -- shows what is happening .	78.379486
the report is based on a survey by blyth & company , investment bankers .	14.949114
nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period .	6.235154
and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession .	35.734905
many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter .	36.378204
indication the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward .	10.053688
look , for example , at the ohio turnpike .	9.38723
traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february , as compared with those same months in 1960 .	57.05425
then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs .	22.642694
as a result , the road ' s net revenues in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds .	16.089563
that was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months .	12.404819
that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike .	10.417433
operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in march .	29.09357
costs were held down , despite a bitter winter .	94.93796
for the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period .	17.309483
the road ' s engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston .	38.44232
some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do .	46.436672
the 187-mile illinois state toll highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until december , 1958 .	34.507286
in the 12 months ended in february , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves .	33.93289
in the 12 months ended in february , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest .	9.745086
in the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 .	80.213455
success , for many turnpikes , has come hard .	429.0304
traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers ' rosy estimates .	41.38935
in these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways .	50.982788
many rate increases already have been put into effect .	159.77106
higher tolls are planned for july 1 , 1961 , on the richmond-petersburg , va . , turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study .	25.643627
progress is being made , too , in improving motorists ' access to many turnpikes .	44.791714
net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb . 28 , 1961 .	16.992641
further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city , kans . , and kansas city , mo . .	20.82505
meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road ' s reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years .	97.91505
investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals .	130.20345
traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike .	28.008001
if nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 .	25.918388
west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same .	33.437305
the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement .	99.61271
it ' s going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full .	32.409805
already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins .	89.006035
many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point .	11.931373
a top american official , after a look at europe ' s factories , thinks the u . s . is in a `` very serious situation ' ' competitively .	31.50058
commerce secretary luther hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on may 10 toured plants of two of italy ' s biggest companies -- fiat , the auto producer , and olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines .	35.389996
our staff man cabled from turin as follows --	285.9376
`` follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant , and you learn this	61.032455
`` one , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the marshall plan -- enables fiat to turn out 2 , 100 cars a day .	75.20696
`` two , wage costs are a fraction of the u . s . costs .	6.5596256
a skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week .	13.490293
fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years .	15.105203
`` said secretary hodges ' it ' s a tough combination for the u . s . to face .	27.094105
`` olivetti had a special interest for hodges .	35.682056
olivetti took over underwood , the u . s . typewriter maker , in late 1959 .	16.80535
within a year , without reducing wages , underwood ' s production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed .	67.392365
the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled .	161.02284
`` the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout , modern machinery .	29.777634
the firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious .	6.275742
`` hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the u . s . .	11.245238
the inflow of foreign capital would help the u . s . balance of payments .	10.57487
`` hodges predicted ' i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the u . s . .	26.652079
there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' ' ' .	30.953056
foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports .	58.54452
the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines .	41.367294
important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these	4256.5063
an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy .	49.202106
chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting .	3.6030543
the u . s . will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years .	31.014605
point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet .	92.71497
if they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would .	73.84301
idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible .	26.213947
at the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries .	64.64859
japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily ' ' curbing exports of textiles to the u . s . .	8.394273
hong kong , india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the `` lancashire pact ' ' .	25.934761
none of these countries is happy with these arrangements .	70.27768
the japanese want to increase exports to the u . s . while they have been curbing shipments , they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big u . s . market .	25.74008
hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain , while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly .	29.116604
the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons .	58.34701
the kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in asia and europe will see that `` dumping ' ' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas .	40.97507
gradual , controlled expansion of the world ' s textile trade is what president kennedy wants .	48.94416
this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products .	56.941757
it ' s an important clue to washington thinking .	74.14925
note , too , that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the u . s . textile industry .	11.1311245
`` get competitive or get out ' ' .	2.8908107
in veiled terms , that ' s what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry .	29.630194
the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn ' t seem feasible .	76.9514
special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed .	16.0356
government research will look into new products and methods .	83.334526
import quotas aren ' t ruled out where the national interest is involved .	64.63876
but the kennedy administration doesn ' t favor import quotas .	15.808991
rather , they are impressed with the british government ' s success in forcing -- and helping -- the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products .	66.9298
what ' s happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries .	90.9771
among the highest-paid workers in the world are u . s . coal miners .	9.099065
yet u . s . coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers ' mouths water .	32.295147
steel company of wales , a british steelmaker , wants to bring in virginia coal , cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets .	30.628633
virginia coal , delivered by ship in wales , will be about $2 . 80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines .	17.309187
u . s . coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight .	29.825474
many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting , narrow and very deep .	45.719616
productivity of u . s . miners is twice that of the british .	93.09624
welsh coal miners , communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal .	102.89067
the british government will have to decide whether to let u . s . coal in .	50.393566
the british coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can ' t sell .	33.6527
every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` i ' m sorry , but we don ' t have that book .	22.812767
there wouldn ' t be much demand for it , i ' m afraid ' ' .	11.688986
behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest .	76.66996
what to buy out of the year ' s grist of nearly 15 , 000 book titles ? ?	55.24263
what to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ?	33.86266
a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian ' s salary , and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world ' s richest city .	24.895842
the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse .	55.19658
confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds .	58.718246
in some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis .	64.490395
new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow .	68.69433
because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the new york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works .	44.314472
at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area .	33.188526
at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve .	52.748085
both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state .	76.63816
it was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today .	54.94464
under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts .	162.52336
an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit .	129.48172
some library boards are wary of the plan .	4.802406
a large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great .	72.229126
a small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board .	81.73848
within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved .	62.084282
the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system .	73.94411
all services are given without cost to members .	9.833382
so obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op .	45.372128
to set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100 , 000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it .	40.15473
the collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection .	25.58544
each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency .	58.78714
the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars .	40.337048
in nassau county , for example , the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 .	75.22493
this system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation .	54.932407
the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area .	67.76662
the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford .	67.15886
nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100 , 000 volumes by 1965 .	32.954002
the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers .	94.5447
basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries .	50.882797
on microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals .	43.02128
the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans .	32.42011
it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide .	53.622967
the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries .	41.884624
each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon .	217.3421
east meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion	1821.9902
freeport houses social science , pure science , and language	125.03363
history , biography , and education are centered in hempstead	37.86927
levittown has applied science , business , and literature	492.66553
while hewlett-woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages .	26.218441
the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service .	32.080784
this kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course .	18.427341
public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis .	59.961994
local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library .	38.87939
the system passes on these savings to its members .	13.571237
further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing .	34.97513
books are not the only resource of the system .	34.869095
schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities .	73.23867
the most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge .	97.80726
this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` nanook of the north ' ' , `` the emperor ' s nightingale ' ' , and `` the red balloon ' ' .	23.271872
workshops are conducted by the system ' s audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service .	31.988504
the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together	189.38312
consequently an experienced children ' s librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children ' s librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits .	35.724648
headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection .	89.5679
sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups .	47.752136
story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children ' s consultant .	48.93571
headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries .	59.07393
in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children ' s program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county	61.811813
it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries	33.885
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used	255.78062
and it publishes sum and substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system ' s activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries .	27.410168
the system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership .	22.853394
in nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general .	39.968597
librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today .	75.48868
library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans , the teen-agers .	17.139702
to them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` i ' m sorry , we don ' t have that book ' ' .	18.44916
today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned .	62.432003
the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world .	56.514633
education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society .	69.77898
the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life .	14.809429
we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read	43.192123
if we do not know how to use what we do read .	85.581375
we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word .	95.196754
a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries .	89.22823
although progress has been made in america ' s system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america .	92.703705
the problem grows in intensity each year as man ' s knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand .	47.29449
the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition .	73.43769
there are , for example , approximately 25 , 000 , 000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50 , 000 , 000 with inadequate service .	36.229927
in college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1 , 509 institutions surveyed last year by the u . s . office of education .	19.051039
and over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all .	28.068077
in every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services .	69.43501
only public understanding and support can provide that service .	98.91904
this is one of the main reasons for national library week , april 16-22 , and for its theme `` for a richer , fuller life , read ' ' ! !	91.73209
the general assembly , which adjourns today , has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened .	44.740803
it was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools , an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education .	52.134163
there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight , in which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers .	28.523392
the final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need .	163.77696
long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government .	48.384647
this session , for instance , may have insured a financial crisis two years from now .	144.7417
in all the turmoil , some good legislation was passed .	35.95135
some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action .	38.66706
certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue .	64.8686
no action has been taken , however , on such major problems as ending the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales .	61.64657
only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state .	97.639175
the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions .	38.342136
fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like anything but `` the empire state of the south ' ' .	39.083374
we congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation .	43.714558
in the interim between now and next year , we trust the house and senate will put their minds to studying georgia ' s very real economic , fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics .	100.60872
the league of women voters , 40 now and admitting it proudly , is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive .	52.92639
it ' s a good use of money .	3.7119186
these women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jefferson ' s dictum that one must cherish the people ' s spirit but `` keep alive their attention ' ' .	46.059834
`` if once they become inattentive to the public affairs ' ' , jefferson said , `` you and i , and congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves ' ' .	40.56238
newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs .	150.98665
the league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public .	36.563354
the harder the choice , the more willing the league is to wade in .	53.19575
and the league takes a stand , with great regularity , on the side of right .	24.79986
cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest georgia counties that are members of the coosa valley area planning and development commission .	61.78547
coupling its own budget of $83 , 750 with a $30 , 000 state grant authorized by gov . vandiver , the group expects to sign a contract in march with georgia tech . .	25.710356
then a full-time planning office will be established in rome to work with a five-member georgia tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program .	51.76591
it recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach .	51.226948
the rusk belief in balanced defense , replacing the dulles theory of massive retaliation , removes a grave danger that has existed .	20.421505
the danger lay not in believing that our own a-bombs would deter russia ' s use of hers	18.230438
the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough .	37.823246
by limiting american strength too much to nuclear strength , this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war .	54.82209
this strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war .	5.4779325
it also weakened our diplomatic stance , because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity .	135.176
this left the soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity .	11.143802
by maintaining the nuclear deterrent , but gearing american military forces to fight conventional wars too , secretary of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position .	63.94302
dekalb ' s budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance .	142.20811
it includes a raise in the county minimum wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance .	64.66465
that such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by chairman charles o . emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials .	59.42304
g . mennen williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly .	62.056755
touring africa , the new u . s . assistant secretary of state observed `` africa should be for the africans ' ' and the british promptly denounced him .	28.427114
then he arrived in zanzibar and found africans carrying signs saying `` american imperialists , go home ' ' .	93.8272
confidence in the state ' s economic future is reflected in the georgia power company ' s record construction budget for this year .	69.19588
the firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning .	40.30299
it is good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization .	55.507366
georgia ' s mental health program received a badly needed boost from the general assembly in the form of a $1 , 750 , 000 budget increase for the milledgeville state hospital .	29.034117
actually it amounts to $1 , 250 , 000 above what the institution already is receiving , considering the additional half-million dollars gov . vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus .	47.472065
either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is .	93.65631
but exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing .	248.73401
the practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished .	22.586966
the work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced .	94.79894
more attendants , nurses and doctors should be hired .	30.957897
patients deserve more attention than they are getting .	49.480938
even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year , georgia will be spending only around $3 . 15 per day per patient .	75.551155
the national average is more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low .	105.82866
kansas , regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill , spends $9 per day per patient .	33.03394
but in so many other areas we still are dragging .	30.335522
considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done , it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted .	111.581635
assassination , even of a tyrant , is repulsive to men of good conscience .	53.584053
rafael trujillo , the often blood-thirsty dictator of the dominican republic for 31 years , perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history .	48.43406
but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered .	27.010233
the responsibility for scores of deaths , including the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez , a professor at columbia university in new york , has been laid at his door .	20.66399
he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as president romulo betancourt of venezuela .	32.469822
it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government , reportedly involving the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez , has been uncovered and quashed .	13.133976
the recent history of the dominican republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive .	27.367287
unquestionably trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably .	97.892685
but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition .	174.27225
el benefactor ' s vanity grew with his personal wealth .	45.8134
the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure .	17.871424
he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise , and his influence extended even to congress .	45.22475
until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article of faith with trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character .	83.46301
tardily the government here came to understand how this country ' s own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression .	25.88001
last year , after trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean , the united states and many other members of the organization of american states broke diplomatic relations with him .	20.740856
thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines .	5.2963657
trujillo ' s dictatorship had been along conservative , right-wing lines .	10.428344
but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist slogans .	26.736261
there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba , previously a bete noire to trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces .	27.315266
what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle .	7.832195
the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed .	104.29505
perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger .	69.40727
the dominican republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom .	107.87674
such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people , who deserve to breathe without fear .	33.04277
for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy and help .	43.04017
high-speed buses on the george washington memorial parkway , operating between downtown washington and cabin john , glen echo and brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency can do for this city .	69.71495
in presenting plans for such express buses before the montgomery county council , the administrator of the ncta , c . darwin stolzenbach , was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching .	29.211159
such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area .	43.02554
because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed .	27.83232
the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress .	27.095715
the inference has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city .	85.650566
so far as the record is concerned , the western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so .	48.893543
though walter ulbricht , by grace of soviet tanks , may be head man in east germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone .	34.49135
the wartime protocol of september 12 , 1944 , designated a special `` greater berlin ' ' area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation .	63.047443
it was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by soviet , american , british , and french troops respectively .	69.82514
after the berlin blockade and airlift , the council of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin ' ' .	42.36961
for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas .	26.320042
then they moved offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany .	31.070929
that this and the closing of the east berlin-west berlin border have not been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which britain , france , and the united states sent to moscow after the latter ' s gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other west german officials to west berlin .	44.947376
the chancellor had as much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of gerhard eisler .	21.139296
the british and other replies to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities `` to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany ' ' .	38.846294
they insisted on the `` fundamental fact ' ' that `` the whole of berlin has a quadripartite status ' ' .	25.48619
this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact .	270.2052
there remains , of course , the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts .	118.87062
one ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into west berlin as communist `` vopos ' ' try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents .	77.42202
another remained when an american army car was recovered but with a broken glass .	37.434505
the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed .	11.754664
remembering the step-by-step fate of danzig and the west german misgivings about `` salami ' ' tactics , it is to be hoped that the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedy ' s representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed .	52.658672
thousands of buffalo ( `` bison ' ' they will never be to the man on the street ) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling , dusty-green grassland .	46.34458
a horizon even and seamless , binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth .	37.66367
that picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any later cinema image of the west made in live-oak canyons near hollywood .	42.596798
for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill .	55.278046
the national park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county , northeast kansas , as a `` prairie national park ' ' .	19.601704
there the buffalo would roam , to be seen as a tapestry , not as moth-eaten zoo specimens .	36.92732
wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved .	23.735622
grasslands would extend , unfenced , unplowed , unbroken by silo or barn -- as the first settlers saw them .	26.329336
the park service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park .	223.52942
american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to approve .	31.892635
a philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on tv and radio .	72.30256
starting with small stations not members of the national association of broadcasters , the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations .	25.037733
probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the federal communications commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power .	171.53973
the national association of broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials .	2.3518515
past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy .	69.300125
even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific prohibition .	49.9246
why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads , is it necessary to seek congressional action ? ?	76.54507
simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread .	45.934925
soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors .	45.802784
although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied , there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsie-cola and gulling him into downing bourbon .	24.061981
registered democrats in new york city this year have the opportunity to elect their party ' s candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization .	49.412514
in the central contest , that for mayor , they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other .	51.488407
mayor robert f . wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office .	58.47388
while all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools , law enforcement and fiscal policies .	82.71997
the mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record .	32.691135
state controller arthur levitt , on the other hand , cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city ' s welfare .	47.140476
they , too , have links with the city ' s ills .	13.979635
both men are known to be honest and public-spirited .	6.644962
mayor wagner ' s shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of mr . levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post .	85.875336
as mayor , mr . levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like .	76.64975
his election , on the other hand , would unquestionably strengthen the `` regulars ' ' .	14.144213
mr . wagner might or might not be a `` new ' ' mayor in this third term , now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls `` bosses ' ' .	53.3669
these are , of course , the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote .	263.91483
but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him .	94.20881
if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish , it nevertheless must be made .	129.31569
the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party .	62.891846
both mr . k ' s have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos .	196.91405
president kennedy , already two quiet demands down , still refused thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow .	60.49548
but at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting .	25.352007
and secretary rusk , en route to bangkok , doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian or thai seato forces .	53.677956
for mr . kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation .	64.29922
the new president is in no position to start out his dealings with moscow by issuing callable bluffs .	42.293835
he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says .	105.313934
in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr . khrushchev for the third time .	43.13239
at his press conference mr . kennedy said , `` all we want in laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn ' ' .	59.9756
at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position .	304.1051
since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington , this approach might be expected to head off mr . khrushchev for the moment .	56.96641
but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos , the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot , but would bog washington in a tactical mess .	66.06988
as wars go , laos is an extremely little one .	36.277473
casualties have been running about a dozen men a day .	46.868824
the hard core of the pro-communist rebel force numbers only some 2 , 000 tough viet minh guerrilla fighters .	89.01851
but for the united states and its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough , less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded , road-shy , guerrilla-th ' -wisp terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners .	48.982647
but if anything can bring home to mr . khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this braddock-against-the-indians contest , it will probably be the fact that seato forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington .	61.72454
fortunately both the republicans and america ' s chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos aim of the president .	96.11291
actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table .	60.686916
it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable .	63.33155
the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of 1954 , and last year washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma .	17.731194
but since last fall the united states has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the british plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers .	73.8069
the road to a guaranteed-neutral , coup-proof laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation ' s terrain .	175.34712
but for the safety of southeast asia , and for the sake of the laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made .	50.93464
the world awaits mr . khrushchev ' s choice of alternatives .	28.300169
the senate ' s overwhelming ( 64-13 ) vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower house .	100.996956
twice previously the senate has approved measures backing etv and the house has let them die .	53.951126
the house communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds .	94.74761
this year ' s senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with $1 , 000 , 000 to be used in support of private , state , or municipal etv efforts .	24.223572
the funds would be used for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation .	82.56581
the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value .	97.685745
but , lacking money from commercial sponsors , the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service .	160.27246
other communities -- the ones to be aided most by the senate bill -- have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment .	212.6338
sam rayburn was a good man , a good american , and , third , a good democrat .	51.681892
he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure	3301.0486
mr . speaker , mr . sam , and mr . democrat , at one and the same time .	19.834913
the house was his habitat and there he flourished , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth , speaker of the house , and second most powerful man in washington .	77.33944
mr . rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label .	43.80639
he was no flaming liberal , yet the new deal , the fair deal and the new frontier needed him .	134.5327
he was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any .	76.46521
two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word .	93.096985
sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction .	39.04064
it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs .	258.57993
the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical .	20.146952
a growl , a nod , was usually enough .	142.23904
when it was not , one of the great dramas of washington would be presented .	28.311111
he would rise in the well of the house , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence .	30.165615
he spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes .	15.674862
he made good , plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it .	96.79272
these public efforts were rare because mr . rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the house floor .	116.521935
he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them .	34.707047
with his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political leader .	75.554436
he was , of course , in the house for a very long time .	30.804615
there are only two men remaining in congress who , with rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917 .	33.57495
to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr . sam coincided with that of the house .	36.010082
to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition .	52.280777
the senate to him was not the `` upper body ' ' and he corrected those who said he served `` under ' ' the president .	35.31391
sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death .	69.36291
woodrow wilson , with whom he began his years in washington , warren g . harding , calvin coolidge , fdr , with whom he managed a social revolution .	23.03627
and those still with us , herbert c . hoover , harry s . truman , dwight d . eisenhower and john f . kennedy .	10.536587
he was a fighter for those of his own party .	35.704002
mr . truman has only to recall the `` hopeless ' ' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr . kennedy with congress would have been sadder than it was had not mr . sam been there .	57.53368
as it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration .	36.63459
he was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist .	20.890957
he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was born to play .	27.184952
under any name -- mr . speaker , mr . democrat , mr . sam -- he was a good man .	9.205053
thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends .	126.556114
in 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle .	42.37534
simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river .	36.36942
the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries .	13.869317
in other words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident katanga .	63.011677
does this suggest that the congo is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it ? ?	134.42926
to the contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence .	69.79468
mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences .	43.5385
yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of katanga .	28.206116
it happens in the territory of the leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it .	70.36876
the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ? ?	119.31947
the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa .	107.70999
right now , they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga .	20.887825
that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view .	2.3573608
the un army is too weak , too demoralized for the task .	18.778597
further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned .	39.557938
last , it makes no sense to deliver katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos .	97.51555
the congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence .	12.103169
the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom .	17.614483
it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism .	39.54844
but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach .	71.22578
otherwise , un will march blindly on to certain defeat .	195.18805
a recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the southern pacific co . and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information .	26.398754
the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours ' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year .	62.730923
our comment was that this was `` featherbedding ' ' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement .	38.020542
the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life .	34.78598
additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need .	54.39433
also , normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic .	185.77786
the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries .	114.54593
the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands .	47.131634
time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side .	77.28337
but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in st . louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there .	28.300953
it was , the brief writers decided , `` man ' s best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world ' ' .	57.053867
peace , it ' s wonderful , and `` world law ' ' , it ' s wonderful , too , and shouldn ' t we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon ? ?	43.095123
meanwhile , in moscow , khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can ' t see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism .	44.503304
a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st . louis to the moon , where there wouldn ' t even be any beer to drink .	42.346363
while he was at it , the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can ' t appreciate coexistence thru suicide .	63.72055
`` fools ' ' , he bayed , `` what do you think you are doing ' ' ? ?	23.003254
the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren ' t playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort .	35.739704
another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun .	42.530056
the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana , where , for some unknown reason , castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old ten o ' clock shadow .	35.517727
the plane was sent back to the united states , for a change , but castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution .	40.636585
less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by castro ' s right hand man , che guevara , who edified the inter-american economic and social council meeting in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined from the united states embassy at caracas , venezuela .	35.40122
the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen , who were on hand to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium .	65.66869
perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing american diplomatic papers and planes , but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting american interests , these things would not happen .	43.84713
the same can be said about the half-hearted cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious khrushchev .	78.256775
pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it ' s getting dark down here and we ' re minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away .	73.896164
the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month .	50.063198
the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway , which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car .	76.97704
by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines .	74.92665
the board ' s action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws .	51.21128
word of dag hammarskjold ' s death in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe .	56.894478
as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace , and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously .	44.082684
it was on the eve of a momentous u . n . session to come to grips with cold war issues .	52.987946
mr . hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace .	14.900368
he had sought talks with moise tshombe , the secessionist president of congo ' s katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody .	25.41693
the story of the fatal crash is not fully known .	65.41467
the u . n . -chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired .	33.071583
whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined .	55.730198
the death of mr . hammarskjold removes the united nations ' most controversial leader .	39.401684
he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice .	66.33372
he courageously defended the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc .	25.802603
the congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs .	22.428265
his policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape .	28.012169
when the recent katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr . hammarskjold , despite the danger , flew to exert a calming influence .	35.223854
the u . n . session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing .	93.77501
it is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments .	11.910829
if the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice .	63.351486
reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of greater miami ' s hardest tasks .	49.04671
even when public bodies arrived at a consensus , at least one dissenting vote has been usual .	51.654087
so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity .	6.38335
all nine members of the inter-american center authority voted for goodbody & company ' s proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center .	42.003696
the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract .	72.84062
if the indenture is accepted , the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue .	36.990456
then goodbody will hand over a minimum of $15 . 5 million for developing the spacious graves tract to house the center .	21.59115
the next step awaits approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade county port authority .	10.033519
they allotted $500 , 000 three years ago to support interama until its own financing could be arranged .	45.531666
less than half the sum has been spent , since the interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations .	47.81866
the balance is being budgeted for the coming year .	41.54324
it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed .	185.40662
the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim of $8 . 5 million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project .	29.082003
so have the people ' s elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels .	56.303406
interama , as it rises , will be a living monument to greater miami ' s ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises .	19.517483
progress , or lack of it , toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued last week by the united states commission on civil rights .	63.23746
much happened in this field during the past 12 months .	71.36601
each state advisory committee documented its own activity .	10.844446
some accounts are quite lengthy but florida ' s is the shortest of all , requiring only four paragraphs .	43.12335
`` the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas ' ' , reported this group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south floridians , william d . singer and john b . turner of miami .	60.93182
`` no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group .	51.17653
`` the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights ' ' .	41.982754
problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint .	56.081924
the progress reported by the advisory committee is real .	382.0937
while some think we move too fast and others too slowly , florida ' s record is a good one and stands out among the 50 .	112.62652
west germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead , on berlin and unification , with a coalition government .	37.956627
this is the key fact emerging from sunday ' s national election .	22.941586
chancellor adenauer ' s christian democratic party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 .	44.381554
in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength .	47.812893
the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired .	51.487804
both willy brandt ' s social democrats , who gained 22 seats in the new parliament , and the free democrats , who picked up 23 , will insist on that before they enter the government .	82.68062
moon-faced ludwig erhart , the economic expert , probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him .	173.43835
if he becomes chancellor , dr . erhart would make few changes .	145.36821
the wizard who fashioned west germany ' s astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise .	23.843164
he is dedicated to building the nation ' s strength and , as are all west germans , to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany .	70.395775
what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result .	79.77966
if the party of adenauer and erhart , with 45 per cent of the vote , approaches the party of willy brandt , which won 36 per cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve .	20.114828
west berlin ' s mayor brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it .	35.426422
the free democrats ( 12 per cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the soviet union , and more dealings with the communist bloc .	22.042145
the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility .	79.45848
it could go either way , since the gains for both points of view were about the same .	83.191
regardless of the decision two facts are clear .	5.3993435
west germany , with its industrial and military might , reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations .	76.502625
and the career of konrad adenauer , who upheld germany ' s tradition of rock-like leaders which bismarck began , draws near the end .	91.99562
americans are a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing .	138.3502
but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn ' t want to make a spectacle of himself .	8.386571
for instance , so-called `` conservative ' ' organizations , some of them secret , are sprouting in the garden of joining where `` liberal ' ' organizations once took root .	84.441826
one specific example is a secret `` fraternity ' ' which will `` coordinate anti-communist efforts ' ' .	10.2576885
the principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled .	24.400316
according to the chicago tribune news service , state atty . gen . stanley mosk of california has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name 1 .	40.13925
does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations ? ?	8.517375
does it attack other traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges ? ?	21.848124
does it put the label of un-american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically ? ?	19.44025
does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars , communism , depression , and other troubles of the world ? ?	45.655468
does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns ? ?	109.6529
do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate ? ?	66.166885
in some instances a seventh question can be added 7 .	190.39813
does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government , political party or personality in opposition or preference to the american system ? ?	102.31756
if the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of americans in a troubled time .	13.078206
falling somewhere in a category between einstein ' s theory and sand fleas -- difficult to see but undeniably there , nevertheless -- is the tropical green `` city ' ' of islandia , a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents , limited access and an unlimited future .	58.526936
whatever land you can see here , from the north tip end of elliott key looking southward , belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land .	122.113235
and what you can ' t see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too .	75.735115
the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment .	78.21913
in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida , the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours .	60.048546
in this instance , happily , insistence is being made that our share is protected .	96.05408
and until this protection is at least as concrete as , say , the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach , those who represent us all should agree to nothing .	112.06398
the reaction of certain city council members to california ' s newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing .	41.059776
we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide , and , therefore , had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public .	38.415638
in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes , collectively known as the brown act , the legislature declares that `` the public commissions , boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people ' s business .	30.859087
it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly .	65.3249
`` the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them .	75.55238
the people , in delegating authority , do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know .	53.89177
the full implementation of these noble words , however , has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature .	31.457027
since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted , but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown act .	76.961266
despite the lip service paid by local governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations .	11.240994
when all else fails , it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations .	248.45947
we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims .	38.447685
without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily .	115.601814
but the citizens would , of course , never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious .	89.33169
if the dominican republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the u . s . show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship .	29.24956
mr . balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring .	61.834805
had u . s . warships not appeared off the dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war .	24.244503
ultimately either the trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba .	65.53628
within the organization of american states , there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which was not without risk obviously .	73.441895
but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo ' s waterfront shouting , `` vive yankees ' ' ! !	9.14264
more , the u . s . action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , dr . juan bosch , as having saved `` many lives and many troubles in the near future ' ' .	36.552956
mr . balaguer ' s troubles are by no means over .	69.28453
he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike .	22.215792
in cooperating toward that objective , oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states .	40.745327
those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 .	48.936905
now , as then , it is a matter of jobs .	25.771513
craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim , such as factory maintenance .	112.29828
the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members .	53.88338
that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations .	28.50882
or that ' s what it looked like at the time .	21.238356
but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs .	25.694921
walter reuther , leader of the industrial union faction of the afl-cio , says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor .	29.81931
whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as , say , jimmy hoffa of the teamsters , is a matter of conjecture .	16.100788
but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor .	66.8354
engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival , this country can have little patience with labor ' s family feuds .	69.80054
the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded , and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive .	53.956635
the army , navy and air force , among others , may question secretary freeman ' s claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the `` strongest deterrent ' ' to the spread of communism .	48.369503
but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the `` greatest single source of strength ' ' in the struggle to insure freedom around the world .	37.54757
mr . freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america ' s capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the soviet ' s successes in space .	77.699
american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long time .	22.614958
in fact , over the years , the american farmer ' s capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar .	38.92413
and thus far , mr . freeman has offered very little relief .	65.170334
the 1961 feed grain program , which the secretary sponsored , has been declared a billion dollar fiasco .	23.12501
in exchange for higher price supports , growers pledged reduction in planted acreage .	5.2738905
but the farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer .	24.787395
the result $1 . 1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget .	18.856524
perhaps , as mr . freeman says , american agriculture may stop the communists , but it is also swindling the american taxpayer .	40.41625
a senate subcommittee headed by sen . jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some predictable conclusions .	49.123344
the department needs a clearer `` sense of direction ' ' at the top and it needs fewer , but better , people , sen . jackson says .	64.48551
the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department .	13.311151
president kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance .	41.743134
but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first of all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes .	64.4686
nor does sen . jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy .	33.536926
this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates .	79.97178
but competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what sen . jackson lists as the primary need -- `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them ' ' .	78.50786
the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr . rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged , as sen . jackson puts it , `` in work that does not really need doing ' ' .	46.571415
mr . rusk should also draw comfort from sen . jackson ' s recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved .	40.42202
self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in congress .	179.83769
forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist .	38.86014
but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends .	35.864334
james p . mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn ' t drop below three million a couple of years ago .	85.453735
he lost , but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora .	10.991653
his successor , secretary goldberg , also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months .	48.534622
no betting man , mr . goldberg says he ' s merely `` putting my neck out again ' ' by predicting the rate will go down this month .	84.28481
he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride -- a new record high in personal income , an increase in housing starts , a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods .	49.213264
mr . mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated .	121.573494
mr . goldberg has less reason for missing .	5.319331
the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can ' t be blamed in november .	75.68865
the odds thus appear favorable that the secretary ' s neck may be spared .	26.253696
cambodia ' s chief of state , who has been accused of harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand , insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia .	56.856644
but so convinced of communism ' s inevitable triumph is prince sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel .	35.119534
`` i have to see the facts ' ' , is the way the prince puts it .	38.09767
and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-western posture .	180.4549
prince sihanouk ' s powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions .	30.414278
commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington ' s economic forecasters .	32.72554
weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement .	48.31862
recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr . hodges ' appraisal , though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house .	41.466335
and now mr . hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point .	55.65215
he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump .	22.384966
the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales .	13.145517
february ' s volume was 1 per cent above january ' s for the first pickup since last october , although it ' s still 1 . 5 per cent off from february 1960 .	44.955284
corroborating mr . hodges ' figures was the federal reserve board ' s report of the large sales increase in the nation ' s department stores for the week ending march 4 .	37.155495
in newark , for example , this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level .	23.153227
of course , some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 .	43.467102
another optimistic sign , this one from the labor department , was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments `` was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb . 25 ' ' .	46.953045
initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8 , 100 in the week ending march 4 .	34.562927
mr . hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn ' t think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes .	29.457453
well , we can ' t have everything .	21.449293
prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut .	150.55185
new jersey folk need not be told of the builder ' s march to the sea , for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain .	61.288456
now the stone harbor bird sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state .	40.62185
against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline , the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant .	18.26445
but interior secretary udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves .	74.337654
the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30 , 000 acres of cape cod , from provincetown to chatham , is strengthened by president kennedy ' s interest in that area .	24.576883
but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern , for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country .	89.34349
by comparison , stone harbor bird sanctuary ' s allies seem less formidable , for aside from the audubon society , they are mostly the snowy , common and cattle egrets and the louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there .	73.594
but there is hope , for conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space .	92.74416
the desirability of preserving such places as the cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year .	24.381666
public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing .	38.278545
much of the glamor president kennedy ' s peace corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent shriver , the head corpsman .	38.337284
anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to mr . shriver , get off the train right now .	52.34732
first of all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling .	3.9533944
then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet , culture , language and living conditions will be different .	82.05147
and the pay , of course , will be nil .	1.895797
despite all this , the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else .	53.067898
the study of the st . louis area ' s economic prospects prepared for the construction industry joint conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st . louis survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouri-illinois countryside .	62.88558
st . louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region .	21.282215
slackened regional demand for st . louis goods and services reflects the region ' s relative lack of purchasing power .	80.56566
not all st . louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood .	51.932693
but for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core .	31.061226
the city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern illinois .	104.63747
gov . dalton ' s new commerce and industry commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry .	56.588818
another would be to take the advice of dr . elmer ellis , president of the university of missouri , and provide for an impartial professional analysis of missouri ' s economy .	26.25548
he says the state , in order to proceed with economic development , must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy .	44.424885
the research center of the university ' s school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake the analysis dr . ellis has been talking about .	52.739388
he and dean john w . schwada of the business school outlined the project at a recent conference .	91.61817
the university can make a valuable contribution to the state ' s economic development through such a study .	29.726198
in southern illinois , the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth .	35.43436
the carbondale industrial development corp . has obtained a $500 , 000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs .	25.13186
carbondale is in the herrin-murphysboro-west frankfort labor market , where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average .	34.369442
the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri ' s depressed areas , and in the long run that will benefit st . louis as well .	32.66438
politics-ridden st . clair county in illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development .	44.16258
more industrial acreage lies vacant in st . clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st . louis area .	41.901367
the unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side .	103.570206
and then there is st . louis county , where the democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning , of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth .	36.40728
st . louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests .	79.91311
some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean st . louis county doesn ' t want industry , and so they avoid the area , and more jobs are lost .	57.05202
metropolitan st . louis ' s relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political , business , civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi .	38.828163
without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area ' s economy , there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters , and st . louis will slip into second-class status .	40.639908
many of our very best friends are reformers .	5.8071337
still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far .	45.14594
take , for example , the reformers among new york city ' s democrats .	34.648666
having whipped mr . de sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall , they have changed the name to chatham hall .	40.119915
even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building , do they believe that they can make the new name stick ? ?	56.60069
granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame , the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit .	41.91993
but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the tammany name .	11.797475
after all , it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-american , the days in which the sons of st . tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence -- the british government , that is .	31.282793
further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo ? ?	12.225855
they will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant .	18.145697
instead of attempting the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger ' s stripes are not black ? ?	30.59364
the white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official , col . mariano faget , from his preposterous position as interrogator of cuban refugees for the immigration service .	25.847778
the faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds .	8.997242
the kennedy administration had assured anti-castro cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of dictator batista .	30.86158
using a batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro .	69.201294
moreover , col . faget ' s information on cuba was too outdated to be useful in `` screening ' ' castro agents	52.49371
the colonel fled to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized power .	29.378345
and while he had headed batista ' s anti-communist section , the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be communists .	49.827957
responsibility for the faget appointment rests with gen . j . m . swing , an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service .	26.927763
gen . swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office .	34.59739
some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend , congressman walter of pennsylvania , at a moment when the kennedy administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it could get .	38.419174
congressman walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters , but he has announced plans to retire in 1962 .	22.707508
at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen . swing .	32.98099
the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat .	85.36239
as president , dwight d . eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics .	17.637005
as a former president , however , mr . eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a new york republican rally , and generally missed his target .	43.89521
mr . eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a `` juvenile experiment ' ' and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon .	46.839844
nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad .	48.53885
his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding .	22.866371
the former president blithely ignored recent history in speaking of `` dollarette ' ' dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies .	82.089584
it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit .	4.495034
finally , mr . eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington .	61.50742
this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis , when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too .	67.30746
the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded .	46.707508
ex-presidents , relieved of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words .	136.63994
some of former president truman ' s off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein .	37.969753
nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics , but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility .	46.831318
this is a matter of respect for the presidency .	21.383553
mr . eisenhower ' s new york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship .	168.67085
the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed , luxury , and impeccable british service on the high seas .	49.245922
reports that the venerable liner , which has been in service since 1936 , was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us .	43.546246
but the cunard line , influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment , has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least .	109.659805
a new queen , with the prosaic title of q3 , had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary .	18.642015
the british government , concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry , had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling $50 , 400 , 000 toward the $84 , 000 , 000 cost of a new 75 , 000-ton passenger liner .	23.749342
since 1957 , more and more trans-atlantic passengers have been crossing by air .	47.84342
economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines .	49.947838
competition from other steamship lines has cut cunard ' s share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run .	52.643192
the cunard line has under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than 75 , 000 tons .	33.77722
this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months .	26.306585
also under consideration is an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to serve new york .	31.080746
the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation .	98.023796
gen . maxwell taylor ' s statement in saigon that he is `` very much encouraged ' ' about the chances of the pro-western government of viet nam turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to bolster the vietnamese army .	17.436874
gen . taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet nam and , judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east , he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military , economic , political and other resources .	32.717583
there was good reason for gen . taylor to make an inspection trip at this time .	23.66356
communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a new crisis .	22.19735
south viet nam ' s rice surplus for next year -- more than 300 , 000 tons -- may have been destroyed .	29.53464
the viet cong , the communist rebels , may have lost their stored grain and arms factories .	64.037605
the rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in november .	59.72532
nothing that is likely to happen , however , should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than instructional missions .	68.181305
the indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 , when gen . ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the french were losing .	58.46705
it is a war to stay out of today , especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently does not want united states troops .	35.592678
he may want additional technical help , and this should be forthcoming .	12.21891
south viet nam has received $1 , 450 , 000 , 000 in united states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b . johnson ' s visit last may .	42.336308
gen . taylor , the president ' s special military adviser , is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure .	35.63911
it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable , and that they will not lead to involving the united states in an asian morass .	27.893454
gov . john m . dalton , himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government , spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly , or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained , not because of their legal talents , but because of their government influence .	77.30121
ambassador stevenson yesterday described the u . n . ' s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late dag hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced ' ' .	25.196043
if the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as mr . stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill ' ' to a u . n . without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning .	57.176014
the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be , as the charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the organization ' ' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the organization ' ' .	51.534447
in other words , the secretary general is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one .	60.07117
he should be , as dag hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world .	24.22595
the charter does stipulate that `` due regard ' ' shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible ' ' .	33.843918
the united states and its allies have had no objection to this .	22.635284
what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold ' s death to turn the entire u . n . staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come .	46.650295
the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary general and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them .	56.31546
although the united states and the u . s . s . r . have been arguing whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work .	38.99957
if any one of them has any power to veto the secretary general ' s decisions the nature of the organization will have changed .	40.9526
if they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the u . n . will not of necessity change .	59.92369
the secretary general must have , subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else ' s instructions .	42.931126
this is the root issue for which the united states should stand .	50.630474
we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography .	136.49934
what we must have , if the united nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it , subject to no single nation ' s direction and subservient to no single nation ' s ambition .	62.071964
the new city charter , which should get a yes vote as question no . 1 on nov . 7 , would not make a good mayor out of a bad one .	114.23181
there is no such magic in man-made laws .	1.8120475
but it would greatly strengthen any mayor ' s executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the board of estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy .	60.58066
lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor .	44.22865
thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative .	35.144848
the board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions .	18.216948
the board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget items , subject to the mayor ' s veto	55.85814
but the city council will now share fully this budget-altering power .	75.51781
overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and council , and a two-thirds vote .	32.977722
the controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog ' ' functions	7.187619
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed .	75.80463
he loses now-misplaced tax collection duties , which go to the finance department .	44.659477
on net balance , in spite of controller gerosa ' s opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office , the controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now .	66.7467
borough presidents , while retaining membership in the board of estimate , lose their housekeeping functions .	42.660206
highways go to a new department of highways , sewers to the department of public works , such street cleaning as borough presidents now do ( in queens and richmond ) to the sanitation department .	32.01395
the expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department .	135.82755
the capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises	55.572914
but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds .	86.86932
a road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected .	109.77925
this will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business	1130.9607
enlargement of the city council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow .	54.731377
the inter-american press association , which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape horn , is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in eleven years .	32.392036
the i . a . p . a . is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere	32.446823
and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution .	24.811672
as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime , more and more cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were forced into exile .	20.378178
the i . a . p . a . found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it knew before batista ' s dictatorship began in 1952 .	41.244904
freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances .	49.788773
this , in more diplomatic language , is what adlai stevenson told the newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states government .	31.13787
he felt able to end on a note of hope .	5.5347753
he sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms .	84.842155
no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the inter-american press association .	17.472746
the twenty-second soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced .	65.403725
according to the original program , premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the `` bold program for building communism in our time ' ' which the congress will adopt .	78.88206
but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have achieved utopia by 1980 , the world is watching moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future .	78.60087
the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russia ' s progress painted by the communist party ' s program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier khrushchev ' s berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered .	33.339836
whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated .	55.628216
and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive .	127.55667
this congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years .	43.26687
the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress , and the central committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job .	79.496796
dr . james b . conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer .	23.573414
his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change .	187.4192
now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , including new york , has shattered this optimism .	61.808514
dr . conant has come away shocked and angry .	31.673363
his new book , entitled `` slums and suburbs ' ' , calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster .	40.71473
there is room for disagreement concerning some of dr . conant ' s specific views .	19.533545
his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for , and achieved , this open or permissive enrollment .	88.43668
dr . conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality .	36.328938
his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical , law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend .	196.06247
but these are side issues to a powerful central theme .	22.047297
that theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk .	2.2839558
it labels the slums , especially the negro slums , as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters .	12.674723
the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and dr . conant accuses employers and labor unions alike .	32.23586
the facts , he adds , are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools , regardless of the color of their students .	96.69257
a call for action `` before it is too late ' ' has alarming implications when it comes from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , cautioned so strongly against extreme measures .	49.32065
dr . conant ' s conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation ' s gratitude .	19.160444
he has served in positions of greater glamour , both at home and abroad	40.027267
but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools .	60.344456
a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail .	35.497967
he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers .	43.48865
in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress , each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district .	36.52387
this means an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably means an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent writes , think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis .	55.299614
occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another , but these are mostly typewritten .	130.68382
most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter .	127.364494
old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery .	8.749003
she had , she said , heard that the plant was closing .	68.24053
it couldn ' t close , she said .	4.4103227
she had raised a calf , grown it beef-fat .	2.8219213
she had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watched them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear .	25.131165
she was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter .	41.236217
she had done it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people were dependent upon these cans for food .	53.54824
this did not happen in counties of north georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land .	96.182594
nor in south georgia , where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields .	101.00683
this happened in decatur , dekalb county , not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian atlanta .	53.69141
and now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the dekalb county cannery .	15.306026
`` is it so the cannery is going to close ' ' ? ?	21.416447
o . n . moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , didn ' t know what to say .	28.020224
he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer .	29.735725
he did say he was out of cans , the no . 3 ' s , but `` i requisitioned 22 , 000 ' ' .	53.79971
he said he had no . 2 ' s enough to last two weeks more .	48.460102
threat of closing the cannery is a recent one .	411.1351
a three-man committee has recommended to commission chairman charles o . emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed .	14.671297
reason the cannery loses $3 , 000 yearly .	16.367754
but dekalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money .	34.29018
`` the cannery ' ' , said mrs . lewellyn lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the `` victory garden ' ' produce , `` is a service to the taxpayer .	28.894169
and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up .	76.850555
`` the county , though , seems more interested in those people who don ' t even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food ' ' .	71.91453
a driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a . m . finishes before breakfast , then goes out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked , `` what in the world will we do ' ' ? ?	64.485565
`` what in the world ' ' , echoed others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes , `` will any of us do ' ' ? ?	52.109287
moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , doesn ' t believe it will close .	38.48333
but he is in the middle , an employe of dekalb , but on the side of the people .	12.364381
`` don ' t ask me if i think the cannery helps ' ' , he said .	6.567296
`` sir , i know the cannery helps ' ' .	5.44973
most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard .	207.74312
when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say , `` just forget it ' ' .	41.84145
a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge .	49.455875
i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades .	17.521273
one night , at the close of the evening service , he came forward , left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to god .	44.960648
after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land .	65.506004
`` we tried to settle this dispute ' ' , he said , `` but could never come to an agreement .	18.845547
i settled it tonight ' ' , he continued .	58.446423
`` i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart , i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor ' ' .	27.699562
forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god .	12.961092
you cannot wear the banner of god and at the same time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart .	25.182213
henry van dyke said , `` forgive and forget if you can	100.59821
we must , first of all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure god ' s forgiveness .	56.300053
`` for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive -- your trespasses ' ' .	32.662613
it will do no good to seek god ' s forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong .	53.816013
then , jesus indicated that god ' s forgiveness is unlimited .	31.427418
in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words , `` forgive us our debts ' ' .	24.826437
when a person meets god ' s requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven .	21.656284
god ' s mercy and patience will last forever .	20.80511
forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by god ' s love .	34.46506
it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past .	36.547543
we want the past forgiven , but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future .	40.593582
finally , we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us .	156.79636
once peter asked , `` how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? ?	27.43784
jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven ' ' .	44.150093
jesus not only taught forgiveness , he gave us an example of it on the cross .	43.30407
with all the energy of his broken body he prayed , `` father , forgive them , for they know not what they do ' ' .	38.08216
she ' s been in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she ' s still a teen-ager who looks like a baby , she is getting married .	55.65223
her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said .	69.85864
for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldn ' t have made myself heard if i ' d had the equivalent of the message to garcia .	27.77758
but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute .	39.22971
`` how do you know you love somebody enough to get married ' ' ? ?	33.31292
it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked how can you be sure ? ?	46.11837
`` aren ' t you sure ' ' ? ?	3.2634718
i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important .	84.31359
but if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage .	93.36452
besides , in all honesty , i don ' t know how you can be sure .	10.934487
i don ' t know any secret recipe for certainty .	27.15037
in the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured .	94.72795
i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth .	53.990486
`` does he ever bore you ' ' ? ?	2.2259588
why , he ' s so darling and ' '	24.725756
`` i mean ' ' , i went on ruthlessly , `` when he ' s not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love , is he interesting ? ?	39.38336
does he care about things that matter to you ? ?	16.017986
can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating ? ?	180.26569
because , honey , i thought silently , there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you ' re hopelessly stranded , together .	48.952938
and if you bore each other then , heaven help you .	203.00566
she came back the other day to reassure me .	9.326296
she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting .	36.712673
she asked if i had other advice and , heady with success , i rushed it in , i hope not too late .	138.4449
jokes , cartoons and cynics to the contrary , mothers-in-law make good friends .	150.42046
i do not know dr . wilson sneed well .	483.4239
but i was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of st . luke ' s church in atlanta .	13.514901
it was the cry of not just one heart	358.81238
it spoke for many in the clergy , i suspect .	82.58376
imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church .	109.974
`` such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments ' ' , he told his members .	47.34756
a minister should not stay `` beyond the time that his leadership should benefit ' ' his church , he wrote , `` for he becomes ordinary .	99.57975
and so the young minister resigned , to go and study and pray , having never passed a day , he told his parishioners , when `` i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you ' ' .	54.519413
his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister , a modest methodist , who said `` i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and i would have it no other way and it is unworthy to think of self .	55.942635
but oh , how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself ' ' .	76.05441
a man who gives himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving .	63.32962
he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach .	46.99501
the good ones are not motivated to seek vainly , nor are they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity .	71.78687
theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards .	2.3404162
yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul .	141.0559
we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and god ' s .	40.33623
we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week , american cash .	50.681885
if we break the minister to our bit , we are buying back our own sins .	68.96119
if he won ' t break , we add to the stress he bears .	181.81688
and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to .	50.215843
we expect him to be noble , and to make us so -- yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be .	102.511246
we expect bestowal of god ' s love through him .	20.204462
the church truly is not a rest home for saints , but a hospital for sinners .	26.67585
yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers , too .	78.394066
mr . podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake .	22.34124
the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure .	142.67058
the evening was not always spent in the same way .	21.524956
this year , on a night cool with the front of september moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod .	70.831474
the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages .	57.208084
in the midst of it all , mr . podger came out on the pod porch , alone .	17.866451
he had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize .	28.313047
the prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging .	26.523006
mrs . podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement .	31.322739
mr . podger sat down in it , pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and then swung his feet up into it .	56.79134
he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him .	88.34961
suddenly one young voice rose above the others .	14.507786
`` but ' ' , it said , `` do you always know when you ' re happy ' ' ? ?	22.604479
the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in mr . podger ' s mind .	47.380886
here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , mr . podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace .	51.38259
it had begun with the blue jay feather .	63.378345
walking along the lake before breakfast , mr . podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight .	24.663406
the winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood .	45.596443
the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet .	35.033188
all day long mr . podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield .	20.139109
would a blue feather in a man ' s hat make him happy all day ? ?	225.40936
but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake .	22.915178
then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it .	40.159813
and there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road .	66.55788
it was doing very well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr . podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car .	57.528633
would he take pains to avoid it ? ?	1.0168012
taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , mr . podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness .	26.204805
the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon .	86.63664
but mr . podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other .	27.943176
here in the cool darkness mr . podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight .	53.40123
for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama .	97.70489
the three would never meet again , but for some reason or other mr . podger was sure he would always remember the incident .	61.251705
at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr . podger ' s hammock purchase .	29.739023
`` i like them things , too ' ' , he had said .	10.437636
if you ' re lyin ' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap ' em right over you .	48.575546
i do it , lots o ' times -- i like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it ' s all quiet .	44.039886
the wind moves it a little bit -- you know .	45.751904
mr . podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice .	69.35696
as he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , mr . podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet .	35.126904
alacrity , the podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and then , sure of a welcome , hopped up .	76.54638
she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly , and mr . podger took her inside the fringe .	34.600723
soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod .	20.059402
mr . podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and pam burst out .	19.586863
`` it ' s getting so chilly we ' ve lighted a fire , and we ' re going to tell a round robin story -- a nice , scary one .	20.970657
why are you out here all by yourself ? ?	4.7006855
mr . podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire .	53.953957
`` of course i am ' ' , he said .	5.085886
i just came out here to know it ' ' .	5.366087
as the south begins another school year , national and even world attention is directed at the region ' s slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools .	103.213165
desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities -- dallas and atlanta .	42.47974
in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment .	58.55795
these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully .	24.805277
the programs do not take sides on the issue itself .	75.60136
they point out simply that `` it is the law of the land ' ' .	6.427226
the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation .	40.506077
even better , they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs .	48.88063
in each case there was an initial act of violence .	8.432483
in houston , there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes , none of which were serious .	43.79178
in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents .	34.241543
the nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south .	87.056015
it is a `` stair-step ' ' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade .	39.267036
each year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated .	269.98703
the schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , `` so why not now ' ' .	31.155872
the program has worked well in both nashville and houston .	5.1411104
it met a serious rebuff in new orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents .	73.61201
another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program .	26.916979
generally , throughout the south , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met .	49.22585
perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas .	253.86855
during the summer , negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments .	24.983717
it was part of a citywide move toward full integration .	109.56484
so successful has been this program , worked out by white and negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months .	23.878736
hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars .	98.049934
already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis .	20.686129
several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis .	20.906448
this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of dallas .	25.090525
it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south .	62.191242
southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights .	107.228806
they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots .	40.649055
all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it .	142.59741
business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence .	22.506527
they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order .	70.56765
in the past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way .	40.382496
and as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up .	28.789991
this co-operation has emboldened other southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation .	44.316826
they realize that by acting in concert , rather than individually , they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise .	54.69837
since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a few months ago , i ' ve been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship .	22.002256
played mostly on the freeways around los angeles , it goes like this	120.826935
a driver cruising easily at 70 m . p . h . in lane a of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead .	21.47449
traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into lane b , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m . p . h . .	39.016205
the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him .	110.18437
he can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a	51.527027
( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes	220.20668
or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair .	55.504826
the really remarkable thing to me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access .	43.655853
whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , i don ' t know .	13.76976
but it is done , consistently and i ' m both surprised and impressed .	73.78012
this could never happen in my native chicago .	6.9604936
there such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood .	12.629436
in chicago , the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back .	60.37044
failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly .	13.668136
this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to southern california drivers .	50.744747
at the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at marshall field and company , i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype .	99.182205
after three months of research , i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers i ' ve ever encountered .	67.235725
during one recent day of driving about los angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street .	55.775925
an out-of-town writer came up to paul richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year .	104.42627
now richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go .	119.26015
he can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa .	18.494429
this happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece .	65.90682
`` it ' s a whole lot easier ' ' , he said , `` to increase the population of nevada , than it is to increase the population of new york city ' ' .	12.470392
and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher .	22.554
`` that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote ' ' , said the writer , scratching his head .	21.406675
`` now , if i can just figure out what he ' s talking about , i ' ll use it ' ' .	21.192343
this was just richard ' s way of saying that last year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open .	188.66881
some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs .	171.04991
it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so far it hasn ' t worked that way .	55.324375
this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one .	51.85486
you ' d never guess it from the way they ' ve played so far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 .	57.33789
obviously , if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league , it will have to show improvement someplace .	43.841976
where can that improvement possibly come from ? ?	1.0418544
you certainly can ' t expect the infield to do any better than it did last year .	37.689182
brooks robinson is great , and it is conceivable that he ' ll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 .	54.175964
you can ' t expect it , though .	36.701267
robby ' s performance last year was tremendous .	10.800781
it ' s the same with ron hansen and jim gentile .	13.775014
if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint .	38.882572
they shouldn ' t be asked to carry any more of the burden .	49.244183
hansen will be getting a late spring training start , which might very well set him back .	143.9101
he got off to an exceptional start last season , and under the circumstances probably won ' t duplicate it .	26.788736
there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year .	119.91625
they don ' t expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat .	213.3838
he ' ll still be a top player , they concede , because he ' s got a great glove and the long ball going for him .	48.88108
but they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production .	250.07191
gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs .	11.762996
i have a hunch marv breeding might move up a notch .	15.065187
but even so , he had a good year in 1960 and won ' t do too much better .	27.876188
so , all in all , the infield can ' t be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second to first .	71.60186
and the pitching will also have trouble doing better .	29.558937
richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season .	96.66182
where , then , can we look for improvement ? ?	32.74673
`` from triandos , brandt and walker ' ' , answers richards .	17.469149
`` they ' re the ones we can expect to do better ' ' .	40.437935
the man is right , and at this time , indications are that these three are ready for better seasons .	108.05574
triandos hasn ' t proved it yet , but he says he ' s convinced his thumb is all right .	40.631313
he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury hasn ' t bothered him .	31.45546
if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively .	67.74953
i ' m still not convinced , though , i ' ll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him .	65.55578
hank foiles , backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the minors , make up better second line catching than the birds had all last year , but gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant .	86.75268
to me , brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year .	52.979088
he hasn ' t played too much , because richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice .	39.84264
he ' s hitting the ball hard , in the batting cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year .	45.57228
when he came to baltimore , he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league pennant , and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club .	62.454067
he was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field .	62.57802
as of now , that all seems behind him .	18.173178
he ' s been entirely different all spring .	11.676794
and walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year .	66.51781
let him bounce back , and he could really set up the staff .	264.7092
so , if the orioles are to improve , brandt , triandos and walker will have to do it .	15.748698
so far the platoons on left and right fielders don ' t seem capable of carrying the load .	32.55429
of course , this isn ' t taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york city , but it ' s the way things look from here at this point .	37.23001
is the mother of an `` autistic ' ' child at fault ? ?	19.155426
( the `` autistic ' ' child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self .	37.572903
he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people .	87.81335
) did his mother make him this way ? ?	17.514818
we believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn .	25.459984
a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties .	140.52863
sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them .	78.63217
but we don ' t think she creates them .	11.64127
we don ' t think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic .	57.903336
the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often , by sharing her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem .	38.95347
since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we ' d like to share one experienced mother ' s comments .	75.733635
as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , i have to manipulate my son ' s fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy .	39.416016
he wants me to do everything for him .	2.8261132
`` you don ' t believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them .	66.33833
but i do and my psychiatrist does , too .	85.98354
i know , that my son wants control and direction , but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction .	173.13882
`` one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned .	74.88951
this is that autistic people don ' t enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and i .	102.99464
when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board .	108.42317
he pushes and straightens himself as if he can ' t stand the feeling of being held .	54.98191
physical contact is uncomfortable for him ' ' ! !	27.910736
as a rule , the autistic child doesn ' t enjoy physical contact with others .	22.951933
parents have to find other ways of comforting him .	66.72598
for the young child this may be no more than providing food , light or movement .	89.44647
as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his `` magic ' ' thing ) .	68.52081
or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick .	60.673176
the answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer .	73.46031
`` dear doctors we learned this year that our older son , daniel , is autistic .	56.16922
we did not accept the diagnosis at once , but gradually we are coming to .	53.26847
fortunately , there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend , with a group of normal children .	42.709187
`` i try to treat daniel as if he were normal , though of course i realize he is far from that at present .	109.84245
what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible .	64.07219
i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible .	54.23682
`` what is your experience with autistic children ? ?	4.5365896
how do they turn out later ' ' ? ?	3.4458568
many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives .	25.028263
certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood .	88.15822
-- a first grader colors pictures one solid color , everything -- sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc . .	38.457462
when different colors are used , she is just as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc . .	91.43426
the other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color .	102.129944
should i show my daughter how things should be colored ? ?	11.129689
is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ? ?	29.382883
-- her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring , without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects .	82.041176
this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade .	20.068066
no , coloring isn ' t exactly something you teach a child .	34.755188
you sometimes give them a little demonstration , a little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines .	42.571922
but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration .	50.555122
seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art embroidery .	36.302048
possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed .	26.979101
just as a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery .	53.674297
one such , in fact , is a rug .	55.77478
though not actually crewel embroidery , it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background .	44.46026
the twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in england .	30.481718
traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country .	39.966457
the work is executed in england ( by hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color .	27.932459
among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color .	27.920599
for a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine english chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically chinese-inspired design of this revered eighteenth century period .	21.812008
since the work is done by hand , the only limitation , it is said , `` is that of human conception ' ' .	16.552286
modern embroidered panels , framed and meant to be hung on the wall , are another aspect of this trend .	17.971468
these have never gone out of style in scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts .	36.686832
an amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by picking up her living room color scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room .	57.945732
california democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers ' backyards .	67.531815
and they ' re confident that the gop , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine .	21.855207
their meeting at san francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the california democratic council directorate .	26.60463
but it will include 200-odd officeholders , organization leaders and `` interested party people ' ' .	37.21088
-- plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in los angeles next december that would enlist top-drawer democrats from all over the country .	47.850307
-- blueprints for doubling the cdc ' s present 55 , 000 enrollment .	27.373693
-- arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in fresno next jan . 26-28 .	17.12539
-- and proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state ' s 38 new congressional districts .	27.803509
at the head of the cdc is an unorthodox , 39-year-old amateur politico , thomas b . carvey jr . , whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircraft ' s moon missiles .	50.91158
he ' s approached his democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion .	13.040527
viewed from afar , the cdc looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees , and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups -- 500 or so .	78.61545
much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every `` volunteer ' ' democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the aj .	70.74044
moreover , the entire state democratic hierarchy , from gov . brown on down to the county chairmen , also participates in this huge operation .	74.480576
contrarily , republican `` volunteers ' ' go their separate ways , and thus far have given no indication that they ' d be willing to join forces under a single directorate , except in the most loose-knit fashion .	72.361946
carvey believes that reapportionment , which left many democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase cdc membership .	101.02321
where only one club existed before , he says , two will flourish henceforth .	27.747086
biggest organizational problem , he adds , is setting up cdc units in rock-ribbed democratic territory .	76.217674
paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party ' s favor , strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly even basis .	67.71713
like most democratic spokesmen , carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously `` partisan year ' ' .	48.46535
hence the attention they ' re lavishing on the aj .	39.680992
in all probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for congress , and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites .	56.41047
this bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who don ' t see eye-to-eye with the aj .	35.994656
naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council .	44.836823
shunted aside by the rampant organizers for john f . kennedy last year , who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential campaign , the cdc plainly intends to provide the party ' s campaign muscle in 1962 .	19.541094
there is evidence that it will be happily received by gov . brown and the other constitutional incumbents .	32.46983
carvey considers that former vice president nixon would be brown ' s most formidable foe , with ex-gov . knight a close second .	46.45871
but the rest of the gop gubernatorial aspirants don ' t worry him very much .	23.721756
in his cdc work , carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of california ' s shrewdest political strategists former democratic national committeeman paul ziffren , who backed him over a northland candidate espoused by atty . gen . stanley mosk .	18.106853
( significantly , bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw mosk moving into the national committee post over ziffren are still audible in party circles .	63.24382
note we ' ve just received an announcement of the 54th assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention wednesday night in south pasadena ' s war memorial bldg . , which graphically illustrates the cdc ' s broad appeal .	11.5648365
state and county committeemen , cdc directors and representatives , members of 16 area clubs , and `` all residents ' ' have been invited .	44.839508
this is going to be a language lesson , and you can master it in a few minutes .	23.934214

once you learn how to translate communese , much of each day ' s deluge of news will become clearer .	96.127396
at least , i have found it so .	16.677002
for some compulsive reason which would have fascinated dr . freud , communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves .	47.390545
they accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty .	51.797035
president kennedy ' s latest warning to the communist world that the united states will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was , somewhat surprisingly , reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the iron curtain .	68.657265
then the communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency .	67.20547
moscow radio from the literary gazette in english to england	21.943958
`` president kennedy once again interpreted the soviet proposals , to sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat , as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism .	27.564941

he also demanded that kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension specifically to crush the cuban revolution , resume nuclear testing , resist more vigorously admission of china to its lawful seat in the united nations , and postpone non-military programs at home ' ' .	69.33407
`` the american press clamored for many days promising president kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the united states .	69.2237
in fact , the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling , the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current president .	31.909203
if there were no west berlin problem , imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the united states and its nato partners .	26.129766
washington apparently decided to use an old formula , by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the u . s . economy after a prolonged slump ' ' .	30.536835
`` the u . s . president has shown once again that the united states needs the fanning of the west berlin crisis to justify the armaments race .	35.457516
as was to be expected kennedy ' s latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in bonn , where officials of the west german government praised it ' ' .	36.36809
`` u . s . pressure on britain to foster war hysteria over the status of west berlin has reached its apogee .	49.88254

`` a better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech .	49.40917
kennedy knows the west will not wage war for west berlin , neither conventional nor nuclear , and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty .	54.421444
whenever some washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn .	44.316826
in kennedy ' s speech are cross currents , sensible ones and senseless ones , reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the president ' s advisers and the political and economic forces behind them .	27.907936
well , dear listeners , despite all the shouting , there will be no war over west berlin ' ' .	39.6084
`` chairman khrushchev received the u . s . president ' s disarmament adviser , john mccloy .	11.967047

the `` west berlin ' ' crisis is really an east berlin crisis .	71.00285
the crisis was artificially stirred up by the kremlin ( wall street ) and the red army ( pentagon ) egged on by the west germans ( east germans ) .	23.90759
the reason was to speed up domestic production in the ussr , which khrushchev promised upon grabbing power , and try to end the permanent recession in russian living standards .	85.28403
chairman khrushchev ( kennedy ) rattles his rockets ( sabre ) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position .	19.848917

aug . 4 , 1821 , nearly a century after benjamin franklin founded the pennsylvania gazette -- a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication -- this paper made its first appearance as the saturday evening post .	86.3456
the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c . atkinson and charles alexander , who had just taken over franklin ' s old paper , desired a more distinctive name .	51.342346
when founded by franklin the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction , poetry , and literary essays .	90.17127
in the middle of the century , with a circulation of 90 , 000 , the post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country .	19.13685
but during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 cyrus h . k . curtis purchased it -- `` paper , type , and all ' ' -- for $1 , 000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany , and with only some 2 , 000 subscribers .	39.417175
little more than a fine old name , valuable principally because of the franklin tradition , the saturday evening post was slow to revive .	88.118454
but curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country .	22.809149

the 350th anniversary of the king james bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament , the first part of the new english bible , undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english .	16.913326
since it was issued in the spring of 1611 , the king james version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the bible .	25.38434
however , biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies , as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced .	23.45703
this resulted in revisions of the king james bible in 1881-85 as the english revised version and in 1901 as the american standard version .	28.302498
then in 1937 america ' s international council of religious education authorized a new revision , in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages .	36.34344
undertaken by 32 american scholars , under the chairmanship of rev . dr . luther a . weigle , former dean of yale university divinity school , their studies resulted in the publishing of the revised standard version , 1946-52 .	11.596592
the new english bible ( the old testament and apocrypha will be published at a future date ) has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version , but , as its cover states , it is offered `` simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading , teaching , or worship ' ' .	59.700462
time , of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose .	70.64077
bible reading , even more so than good classical music , grows in depth and meaning upon repetition .	105.6474
if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years , it will not survive the ages as has the king james version .	85.24073
however , an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars .	50.286766
one is impressed with the dignity , clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english , and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king james .	27.313534
for example , in the third chapter of matthew , verses 13-16 , describing the baptism of jesus , the 1611 version reads	10.336797
`` then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .	31.876202
`` but john forbad him , saying , i have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ? ?	26.032595
`` and jesus answering said unto him , suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness .	177.08394
`` and jesus , when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove , and lighting upon him ' ' .	36.11738
certainly , the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical teachings , in the new english bible which reads `` then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee , and he came to john to be baptized by him .	32.799225
' do you come to me ' ? ?	1.0520387
' i need rather to be baptized by you .	84.23994
jesus replied , ' let it be so for the present	91.6038
we do well to conform this way with all that god requires .	142.36607
after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once , and at that moment heaven opened	87.37916
he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove to alight upon him ' '	17.116531
( the paragraphing , spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version .	49.811783
among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes and yet so few persons , other than scholars , really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning of the sermon on the mount .	53.62784
to illustrate , the first blessing in the king james bible reads `` blessed are the poor in spirit	34.452515
for their ' s is the kingdom of heaven ' ' .	4.0201473
the new version states `` how blest are those who know that they are poor	77.90523
the kingdom of heaven is theirs ' ' .	1.3688306
some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the english language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar .	61.736847
in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains , however , the old phrase `` angel of the church ' ' which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop .	40.10664
for the most part , however , the new version is contemporary and , as such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ .	66.19519
originally recorded by hand , these words have been copied and recopied , translated and retranslated through the ages .	11.443245
discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings , some by the early church fathers , in themselves called for a restudy of the bible .	32.943443
to have the results recorded in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth .	113.821236
with contemporary english changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age , some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic .	92.44326
the new testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the church of england , church of scotland , methodist church , congregational union , baptist union , presbyterian church of england , churches in wales , churches in ireland , society of friends , british and foreign bible society and national society of scotland .	31.303505
prof . c . h . dodd , 76 , a congregational minister and a leading authority on the new testament , is general director of the project and chairman of the new testament panel .	29.394915
sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet .	37.99422
that is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes .	58.98386
there are many soft and light shoe leathers available .	98.02712
many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers .	11.526643
styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape .	30.36621
heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette .	3.5772307
wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights .	28.279303
stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes .	3.8952208
just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps .	14.467235
while white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color .	21.979082
in the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung-like textures .	6.6405787
don ' t overlook the straws this year .	6.191634
they come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors .	42.3452
in the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles .	20.488037
for added comfort some of the italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning .	4.442531
the citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot .	23.432608
orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac .	25.098202
in a brighter nautical vein is ille de france blue .	108.558556
spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black , navy and taffy tan .	22.718746
designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated .	5.0867014
at the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light , but crisp texture .	22.945164
in a lacey open weave shoes have a luster finish , braided collar and bow highlight on the squared throat .	6.2345834
at right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather .	32.092434
an electric toothbrush ( broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the american bathroom .	38.94943
the brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth .	82.572464
in addition , the motor has the seal of approval of the underwriters laboratories , which means it is safe .	31.923197
the unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in .	51.209595
the speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor .	105.27668
the brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own .	47.94168
most of us brush our teeth by hand .	5.361561
the same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men .	36.302204
the electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend .	77.668144
in addition , it is small enough to get into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back teeth .	26.396708
the bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel .	18.37967
it is conceivable that broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly .	35.57155
several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device .	19.6377
the results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly .	85.476845
the electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy .	34.989834
but for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury .	27.335867
it is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles .	11.12571
since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique .	52.514076
writes does numbness in the left hand at night , which awakens the person , indicate brain tumor ? ?	79.80356
this is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand .	134.79211
the pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand .	38.138023
writes do steam baths have any health value ? ?	3.3006384
no , other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder .	51.889812
an ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same .	27.195713
writes what makes my hands numb when sewing ? ?	3.4266245
there are many possibilities , including poor circulation , a variety of neurological conditions , and functional disorders .	12.017248
this manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer ' s cramp .	22.09306
writes does a brace help in sciatica ? ?	1.0177076
a back brace might help , depending upon the cause of sciatica .	11.864322
writes does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed ? ?	10.91209
the cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body .	7.586586
it is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish .	8.876641
the latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed .	12.963338
the gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue .	76.35019
there ' s more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before , although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as thomas alva edison ' s first experiment in recorded sound .	132.44116
edison could hardly have guessed , however , that sophocles would one day appear in stereo .	92.45076
if the record buyer ' s tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records .	39.6171
and he will avoid eye-strain in the process .	6.0072703
everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable .	30.8172
for sheer ambition , take the decca series titled modestly `` wisdom ' ' .	20.486134
volumes one and two , selected from the sound tracks of a television series , contain `` conversations with the elder wise men of our day ' ' .	41.690746
these sages include poet carl sandburg , statesman jawaharlal nehru and sculptor jacques lipchitz , in volume one , and playwright sean o ' casey , david ben-gurion , philosopher bertrand russell and the late frank lloyd wright in the second set .	20.854082
hugh downs is heard interviewing wright , for an added prestige fillip .	67.74665
there ' s more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by dover publications .	56.61378
dover `` publishes ' ' what the company calls `` listen and learn ' ' productions designed to teach foreign languages .	41.1795
previous presentations have been on french , spanish , russian , italian , german and japanese .	33.33443
but the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist ' s desire to visit the `` smaller , less-traveled and relatively inexpensive countries ' ' , and is now prepared to teach modern greek and portuguese through recordings .	40.56335
the respective vocabularies `` essential for travel ' ' are available in separate albums .	11.645144
thanks to spoken arts records , history buffs may hear lincoln ' s `` most memorable speeches and letters ' ' in a two-disc set , interpreted by lincoln authority and lecturer roy p . basler .	42.323498
as a contemporary bonus , the set includes carl sandburg ' s address at a joint session of congress , delivered on lincoln ' s birthday two years ago .	26.29704
for those who `` like poetry but never get around to reading it ' ' , the library of congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work .	66.600266
the program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the recording laboratory of the library of congress , washington 25 , d . c . .	22.650518
newest on the list are john ciardi , w . d . snodgrass , i . a . richards , oscar williams , robert hillyer , john hall wheelock , stephen vincent benet , edwin muir , john peal bishop and maxwell bodenheim .	17.666374
two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above .	188.4975
decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction .	25.469818
rca victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` adventures in music ' ' , which is an instructional record library for elementary schools .	32.010303
howard mitchell and the national symphony perform in the first two releases , designed for grades one and two .	72.69867
in an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future , herbert a . leggett , banker-editor of the phoenix `` arizona progress ' ' , reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties .	22.423452
one of the roughest was the tv quiz shows , which gave him inferiority complexes .	37.076496
though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent , well-informed american .	40.219673
but the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2 , 000 , 000 profit on the stock market .	39.88402
every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb .	51.86892
investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough .	65.84406
people who take us for suckers are like the westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull ' s-eye achievements .	29.516521
the promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it .	31.16839
he just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull ' s-eye .	24.280664
one of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication .	32.665012
if his mother loves him , he clings to that love as a ballast .	38.880188
he wants mommy to think him a good boy .	31.730223
he doesn ' t want her to look frowningly at him , or speak to him angrily .	31.161013
he wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother ' s little helper .	15.760174
but even mother ' s loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior .	24.280642
his desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother ' s love for him and what she expects of him , in order to overcome them .	32.856125
his own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed .	76.2685
it won ' t develop until he has words with which to clothe it .	117.2953
what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ?	4.241772
the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be .	221.3032
she should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child .	50.893486
if he can ' t play with mommy ' s magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own .	71.88988
if daddy ' s books are out of bounds his own picture books are not .	60.035976
toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove .	51.22012
during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child ' s conscience .	25.021318
she tells him of the consequences of his behavior .	9.249148
if he bites a playmate she says , `` danny won ' t like you ' ' .	8.460352
if he snatches a toy , she says , `` caroline wants her own truck just as you do ' ' .	26.011505
there is no use trying to `` explain ' ' to a 2-year-old .	18.84204
remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior .	9.703276
substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act .	36.37778
he won ' t submit to his natural desires all the time , and it ' s mother ' s love that is responsible for his good behavior .	44.18402
this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call `` homecoming day ' ' .	58.904736
they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes .	51.77123
the football opponent on homecoming is , of course , selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the emperor ' s lions .	80.50671
it is true , of course , the uncertainties of life being what they are , that as now and then the christian killed the lion , homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team .	83.59027
even with all possible precaution , homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad , and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them .	53.886543
more often than not , as the old grad wanders along the old paths , his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain .	23.214283
he can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter , and can smell again the aroma of autumn -- fallen leaves , the wine of cool air , and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall .	28.63148
it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates , faces alight , holding hands and talking happily as they come along , oblivious of him , or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances , such as they would give a tethered goat .	43.692673
usually , they titter loudly after they have passed by .	220.74052
he feels , suddenly , the weight of the fat that is on him .	71.03679
his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous .	35.198727
his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary , as if he had walked for miles , instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths .	30.584333
bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth .	45.269917
it is not much better if he meets with old classmates .	30.656622
too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by .	414.16965
he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said , on returning from a homecoming reunion , that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn ' t even recognize him .	64.31201
if they do meet and recognize one another , slap backs and embrace , the moment soon is done .	57.46355
after all , when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children , and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it .	137.90094
by then one begins to notice the middle-age spread	491.44992
the gray hairs , the eyeglasses , bodies that are too thin or too heavy	136.82759
the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then , it is time to break it up and move on .	72.16884
it is , if anything , worse on the old player	168.29037
he sits in the stands and he doesn ' t like that .	10.796584
enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd .	87.69689
on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him .	72.69201
in the stands he is lonely and lost , no matter how many are about him .	45.498966
he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped	25.946203
the churning of straining feet , the rasp of the canvas pants	7.540146
the smell and feel of hot , wet woolen sleeves across his face .	17.119984
and so , he squirms with each play , remembering his youth .	56.430325
no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength , they can never be recaptured again .	30.377832
since the obvious is not always true , the republican national committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred , as suspected , in the larger cities .	55.45702
of 40 cities with populations of 300 , 000 and more , mr . kennedy carried 26 and mr . nixon 14 .	37.056488
there are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election .	111.59021
these are new york , pennsylvania , michigan , maryland , missouri , new jersey , illinois and minnesota .	13.119845
in 1952 mr . eisenhower won all but missouri .	55.978313
yet , in 1960 all eight gave majorities to mr . kennedy .	13.50633
republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia .	9.845922
mr . nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , failed to do so .	26.790102
his visit to warsaw , poland , after the russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the polish vote which , in several cities , is substantial .	43.033672
yet , the gop breakdown discovered that in philadelphia mr . nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called `` polish ' ' vote	35.37802
30 per cent of the `` irish ' ' vote , and 18 per cent of the `` negro ' ' vote .	18.107544
a gop `` task force ' committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities .	70.917015
the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders .	96.073135
these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr . kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment .	35.392418
this error was compounded by declaring the recession to be `` a statistical one ' ' , and not a reality .	35.013847
the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical .	117.61516
they did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor goldberg as politics , which the gop declared it to be .	40.42702
the people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery .	102.68159
senator mundt ' s gross distortion of president eisenhower ' s conversation into a denunciation of president kennedy as too left wing , a statement mr . eisenhower declared to be entirely false , is another case in point .	40.21299
if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hopes in the cities .	111.69252
the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt , goldwater , bridges , dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s .	11.193921
in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr . hoover , and the party ' s failure to anticipate or cope with the depression , caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash .	42.374573
the republican party was not lacking in humanity , but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble .	54.06021
farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks `` hoover carts ' ' .	1.5402098
smokers reduced to `` the makings ' ' , spoke of the sack tobacco as `` hoover dust ' ' .	28.048763
one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership hasn ' t meant to repeat this error .	11.023311
but it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john f . kennedy .	72.81479
that this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new president is conducting the nation ' s business .	24.853033
the most articulate republicans are those who , in their desire to get back at mr . kennedy , already have created the image of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care .	62.74962
if they also defeat the school bill , the gop task force won ' t have much research to do .	40.378433
it will early know why the party won ' t win back city votes .	76.289665
the 1962 general assembly has important business to consider .	89.7978
the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner .	136.65102
after the griffin-byrd political troup has completed the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative forum , this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature in history .	28.15418
every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions .	46.40698
hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever .	96.08949
and just how far can the legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor ' s race ' ' ? ?	27.85469
how unpartisan will be the recommendations of lt . gov . garland byrd ' s senate committee on government operations ? ?	20.62599
the situation already was bad because the legislature moved the governor ' s race forward a few months , causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual .	91.95908
but when former gov . marvin griffin and lt . gov . byrd accepted the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november , the situation was aggravated .	34.985386
neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation .	40.830593
to have refused would have been political suicide .	3.695308
and it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast aside .	66.06603
the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates .	87.92518
it wanted the state democratic executive committee to pick the `` serious candidates ' ' .	17.61398
but state party chairman james gray of albany said no , and he didn ' t mince any words .	22.158234
`` they are just asking too much ' ' , he said .	2.6835494
we can ' t think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either .	152.96747
`` if an opponent accuses you of lying , don ' t deny it .	14.915485
say he is a horse thief ' ' , runs an old adage .	27.154829
if either one ever started making promises , there is no telling where the promises would end .	74.327446
griffin ' s rural roads authority and byrd ' s 60 , 000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper ' s oaths .	22.23519
the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one .	89.66495

the providence journal editorial ( jan . 25 ) entitled `` east greenwich faces a housing development problem ' ' points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours .	66.60817
your suggested solution , it seems to me , is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward , and endorsement of , sound planning .	104.41303
first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested .	97.32328
this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town .	27.169518
the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come .	21.88167
this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither `` to halt an influx of migrants ' ' nor are we `` setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites ' ' .	82.435715
what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development .	29.77113
it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs .	89.93394
bostitch , inc . is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax .	60.71085
the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter , but this particular instance is , in my opinion , completely satisfactory .	69.0576
the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars .	30.919111
with our current $3 per hundred tax rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant ' ' as the best way to meet these problems .	49.065403
in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure .	51.002373
as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow .	109.04816
mr . richard preston , executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission , in his remarks to the governors conference on industrial development at providence on october 8 , 1960 , warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said `` if this is the fundamental reason for a community ' s interest or if this is the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain ' ' .	45.4328
he went on to say `` in the first place , industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities .	53.97077
it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be ' ' .	76.45639
while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth .	119.25343
we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools , and the other facing this prospect next year .	78.66859
it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich school committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase .	67.62001
if they are to be commended for foresight in their planning , what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage ? ?	89.89737
where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials ? ?	132.68394
i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life .	43.123135
the `` fruitful course ' ' of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called .	60.83691
the east greenwich police department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police department , thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the cowessett-east greenwich-potowomut area of the two communities .	21.606152
the east greenwich fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich .	27.3952
the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money , as do other kent county communities , for the support of the kent county memorial hospital , a regional facility .	29.51508
the east greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment .	26.83011
feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick , as reported in your newspapers , suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of warwick along with east greenwich .	41.66611
east greenwich was one of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves .	50.594902
the education program for retarded children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community .	64.78039
i feel compelled to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as east greenwich .	46.729042
i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts	221.2145
and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised .	41.659172
these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when , where , and in what manner the community shall grow .	178.1289
we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions .	28.044699
until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts , i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny .	53.220524
i would like very much , on behalf of my husband and myself , to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the gabrielle fund .	81.88856

a few weeks ago , i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston .	54.683113
the article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over , and must not be going to high school to attend these classes .	78.649155
the following week , i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade .	51.692307
i wish you could see the situation as i see it .	15.57554
if russian pupils have to take these languages , how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language , but have to face so many exceptions ? ?	124.78311
i do not think that america is like russia , not in the least ! !	40.41856
i am proud of my country , the small city i live in , my wonderful parents , my friends and my school	108.03081
but i am also a young , able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language but is not old enough .	109.368675
then people wonder why russian pupils are more advanced than american students .	15.500705
at the height of the first snowstorm we had , it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency .	80.76132
however , the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation .	105.66317
words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me .	78.23506
the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful .	32.889072
the rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather .	40.04001
had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did , perhaps i would not be here to commend them at this time .	36.33533
the providence sunday journal article ( jan . 29 ) asking whether american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for news .	36.375107
usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page .	50.629944
on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans , it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service .	29.864468
it can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come out years later .	58.223083
there is one other point we should never lose sight of many veterans who enter va hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected .	94.255264
no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years .	36.890884
the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case , seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public .	49.17263
i believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals .	11.14314
but i don ' t believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients .	100.010735
this matter is of great importance , and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death , or at least serious injuries , for many veterans .	32.619366
some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long .	96.80564
there ' s a reason for this length of stay .	71.083145
first of all , the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient .	19.924929
he has no experience with this veteran ' s previous medical record .	158.28238
if the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient .	34.320553
as a result , it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient .	52.573933
secondly , the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital , he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient .	35.67382
so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery .	27.862188
the american public must be presented with the facts concerning va hospitalization .	41.7349
the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital , the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other .	43.11426
the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital .	37.652466
an adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals .	138.57283
it seems that open season upon veterans ' hospitalization is once more upon us .	154.92049
the american medical association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer .	34.81759
do they , the a . m . a . , offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world ? ?	78.41781
we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness .	73.64519
nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the a . m . a . on the health problem confronting the aged .	46.097263
they opposed the forand bill , which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction	94.813
yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate .	91.11428
-- no doubt there have been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house has had feelings of frustration , exasperation , exhaustion , and even panic .	33.831516
but no president ever before referred to his as a `` lousy job ' ' ( as walter trohan recently quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen . barry goldwater ) .	50.888935
during his aggressive campaign to win his present position , mr . kennedy was vitriolic about this country ' s `` prestige ' ' abroad .	27.280115
what does he think a remark like this `` lousy ' ' one does to our prestige and morale ? ?	31.492575
if the president of the united states really feels he won himself a `` lousy job ' ' , then heaven help us all .	43.26972
-- defense secretary robert s . mcnamara has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars .	40.390392

top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time .	34.53007
the scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground , sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter .	45.83745
this sum spent for foreign economic aid , the peace corps , food for peace , or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace , increased world trade , and prosperity for every country on the globe .	62.310863
let us prepare for peace , instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization .	67.85994
-- it seems college isn ' t what it should be .	20.06608
i refer to the attire worn by the students .	24.101276
upon a visit to a local junior college last week , i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing bermuda shorts .	16.334633
is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years ? ?	69.65471
education should be uppermost in their minds , but with this attire how can anyone think it is so ? ?	53.43764
it looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves .	53.464874
high school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students .	78.095406

-- in today ' s `` voice ' ' , the cta is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens .	12.437256

but why is it the special responsibility of the cta to help these people ? ?	51.741776
why should cta regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should ? ?	94.719055
the welfare of citizens , old and young , is the responsibility of the community , not only of that part of it that rides the aj .	58.791203

-- in reply to a letter in today ' s `` voice ' ' urging the sale of meat after 6 p . m . , i wish to state the other side of the story .	35.593452
i am the wife of the owner of a small , independent meat market .	126.11076
my husband ' s hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a . m . to 7 p . m . the early part of the week , and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends .	38.400368
now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings -- and sundays , too , for this is coming .	58.76214
there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source , freezing it , and shipping it to outlying stores , where meat cutters will not be required .	31.11213
if a customer wishes a special cut , it will not be available .	12.939848
we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged , whether we want it or not .	67.03801
most women , in this age of freezers , shop for the entire week on week-ends , when prices are lower .	48.174774
also , many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them .	40.06805
and my husband hasn ' t had a vacation in 14 years .	97.73868
but if we closed the store for a vacation , we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block .	58.44221
the meat cutters ' union , which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area , represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets .	96.54665
what it is trying to do is to protect the little man , too , as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores , with choice of cut being made by the consumer , not the store .	72.18257
-- i , too , congratulate the american legion , of which i am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years , on the recent state convention .	24.831438
i regret that bertha madeira ( today ' s `` voice ' ' ) obtained incorrect information .	34.19095
had i been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege , the matter she raised would have been clarified .	102.25342
the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the american flag .	72.25451
judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this .	52.166016
the resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag .	12.33772
it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and , without an amendment to the law , we could not enforce this .	40.743443
my discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises , and not by innuendo criticize them .	45.36671
at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties .	23.037672
-- the illinois commission for handicapped children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children .	21.824207
in these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children , the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field .	26.578758
the illinois commission for handicapped children , which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children , of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois , and of promoting more adequate services for them , indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children .	62.22642

( editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page ) .	94.918816
-- your july 26 editorial regarding the position of attorney general robert f . kennedy on prospective tax relief for dupont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact .	26.524107
as a result , your criticism of attorney general robert f . kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate , unwarranted and unfair .	13.860381
the editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on dupont stockholders , in connection with the united states supreme court ruling that dupont must divest itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings .	20.465668
these proposals would reduce the amount of tax that dupont stockholders might have to pay -- from an estimated 1 . 1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars .	43.468662
congressman wilbur d . mills , chairman of the house ways and means committee , asked the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti-trust law enforcement .	66.13282
the attorney general responded by letter dated july 19 .	3.5510747
copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public .	36.478893
in this letter , mr . kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration -- what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments .	91.747185
there are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the congress , not the department of justice , to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation .	70.70648
yet your editorial said `` now the attorney general writes that no considerations ' justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' ' ' .	56.7483
what mr . kennedy , in fact , wrote was `` it is the department ' s view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' ' .	49.04243
the editorial , by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement , totally distorted mr . kennedy ' s views .	20.337902
the headline is offensive , particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial .	13.550051
-- i concur most heartily with today ' s letter on the futility of writing to sen . dirksen and sen . douglas .	12.666379

-- overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation ' s main industries .	37.147324
in covert socialism -- toward which america is moving -- private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them .	242.07355
in order to attract new industries , 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise .	86.93609

sir -- we are writing in reference to a recent `` suggestion ' ' made to the staff of the public health nursing service of jersey city ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ) .	81.28101
the day before election day , to which we are entitled as a legal holiday , we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as `` workers of the party ' ' .	35.373745
being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being , we felt this wasn ' t a function of our position .	43.57923
as we understand , this directive was given to all city and county employes .	76.41385
to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation .	43.12567
we , therefore , considered the `` suggestion ' ' an insult to our intelligence , ethics , bill of rights , etc . .	18.091068
our only obligation for this day is to vote , free of persuasion , for the person we feel is capable in directing the public .	59.469128
this is our duty -- not as nurses or city employes -- but as citizens of the united states .	31.23979
sir -- i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters .	82.684715
does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves , but ready to demand that `` the community ' ' help and protect them ? ?	34.117516
community shelters are , of course , necessary for those having no space for shelter .	107.04316
if in a town of 2 , 000 private homes , half of them have shelters , the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent .	59.83683
in designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home ' s occupants , `` plus-one ' ' -- so he will be able to take in a stranger .	52.57012
i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart , will get busy and be the first member of our `` plus-one ' ' shelter club .	54.976486

sir -- when the colonies decided upon freedom from england , we insisted , through the declaration of independence , that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity .	25.695581
it is high time the united states began to realize that the god-given rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to katanga .	55.196682
in the united nations charter , the right of self-determination is also an essential principle .	38.586845
the people of katanga had fought for , and obtained , their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga , and his cohorts .	30.766161
by political , economic , geographic and natural standards , they were justified in doing so .	63.099594
the united states and the u . n . denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the katangans .	17.05727
sir -- permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to .	73.04312
the bill which passed the assembly last may and is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny .	60.89072
the procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers .	89.90539
under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed	33.616333
the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate .	20.30572
this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college , and the director and two members of the board of freeholders .	17.442131
it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders , which `` shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed , levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes ' ' .	33.522236
the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college .	19.14848
since two of these could be trustees of the college , actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue .	35.749546
sir -- your editorial , `` housing speedup ' ' , is certainly not the answer to our slum problems .	17.226364
the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions .	43.210293
change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties .	21.05519
then see what a boom in all trades , as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers , will happen .	56.390137
our entire economy will have a terrific uplift .	10.02411
sir -- an old man is kicked to death by muggers .	6.6613293
the medical examiner states that death was due to `` natural causes ' ' .	12.794938
i once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york , it is listed as `` death due to natural causes ' ' .	32.805565
sir -- every resident of this city should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit `` our changing skyline in newark ' ' .	34.94695
it will be at the museum until march 30 .	17.915455
it is a revelation of what has been done , what is being done and what will be done in newark as shown by architects ' plans , models and pictures .	63.70749
it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and certainly make every newarker proud of this city .	98.212814
it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic , school and religious life of the community so that that phase of newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit .	69.75289
sir -- i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway .	22.933586
recently i traveled the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere .	87.646095
one even gave my little dog a biscuit .	6.436142
the viewers of the `` deep peep show ' ' at 15th and m streets nw have an added attraction -- the view of a fossilized cypress swamp .	31.439768
twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site , a black coal-like deposit has been encountered .	29.712008
this is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing .	88.62163
the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay .	55.13534
some of the stumps are as much as three feet long , but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments .	21.20521
although the wood has been changed to coal , much of it still retains its original cell structure .	114.271034
in the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time .	22.03221
these microfossils indicate the swamp was `` formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing .	25.751963
the 15th street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on 17th street reported in the washington post , august 2 , 1955 , which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger .	72.53177
recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air .	75.0029
while i respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that i would like to question .	50.0703
he said , `` let ' s work for peace instead of protection from aggression ' ' .	77.18291
i would ask , `` why not do both ' ' ? ?	15.524975
war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people .	32.84788
are we not late , especially those of us who call ourselves friends , in doing enough about this lack of understanding ? ?	73.57969
as to protection , the speaker disapproved of shelters , pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone .	56.143757
is this a reason for saving no one ? ?	30.653452
would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone ? ?	40.54661
the speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face .	17.870632
if the world comes to this , wouldn ' t it be the very time when courage and american know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild ? ?	35.950966
many of our young people think it would .	201.50684
lastly , the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it `` civilian defense ' ' .	27.107552
in 1950 , public law 920 created civil defense ( different from civilian-groups of world war 2 ) , a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster , natural or manmade .	60.71288
far from creating fear , as the speaker suggests , preparedness -- knowing what to do in an emergency -- gives people confidence .	56.961147
civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve , but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm , flood , accident or even war ? ?	88.62146
it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs .	34.8055
i feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone ' s apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide .	50.40896
in addition , would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash ? ?	56.51342
i grant that the dog may not be really protective , based on his training , but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest , how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog ? ?	54.199837
i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments .	75.27829
use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe ? ?	15.511193
could senator humphrey be serious in his proposal ? ?	13.929547
is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists ' comfort ? ?	21.397635
perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended .	58.50604
the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak .	4.551562
why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat ? ?	45.479034
unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season .	319.22122
as an added suggestion to balance the budget , the government could sell advertising space on the washington monument .	155.52002
it is visible throughout the city , and men from madison ave . would jump at the chance .	120.55248
sen . hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart .	24.022217
he , like most of us , wants to be able to sit , to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors .	44.895317
let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens .	74.95174
let us , like the french , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd .	111.751335
two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint economic committee ( may 2 ) by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work .	56.276726
for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity .	54.572235
the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations .	16.432182
recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations .	37.829765
president kennedy was right when he said , `` we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate ' ' .	23.397505
i have just returned from a seven-week trip to europe and the far east .	58.824715
it is quite evident that the people of western europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war .	16.69871
the fact is that the italians , french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs .	45.25919
we have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war .	32.66538
we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin .	51.88746
it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to prevent us .	7.556757
but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from granting de facto recognition to east germany .	90.424835
soviet russia has been invaded twice by german troops in a generation .	29.702454
in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated .	49.86554
the truth is that communist russia fears the resurgence of german militarism .	6.3595047
berlin is merely being used by moscow as a stalking horse .	9.542993
actually , the communists , out of fear of a united and armed germany , would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the u . n . .	29.252523
if the communists are sincere in wanting a united , neutral and disarmed germany , it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age .	26.25108
it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation .	68.76545
france and other western european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany .	10.343777
if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of austria .	141.98203
president kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called `` operation survival ' ' which has many facets .	35.974243
why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states ? ?	25.826021
a united germany , freed of militarism , might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world .	42.528004
in your editorial of sept . 30 `` the smoldering congo ' ' you make the following comment `` far too many states are following the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments .	91.79659
it is up to the assembly to take action against them .	22.49637
they are violating their charter obligation , the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion ' ' .	16.296267
i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations	5.067217
the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization .	23.201359
the expenses of the organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly .	24.000122
a member of the united nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years ' ' .	42.329334
the u . s . s . r . and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget .	38.87191
but they refuse , as do the arab states , to support the united nations ' expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel , and the u . n . troops in the congo , which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations , but by a special budget .	27.118328
according to the official interpretation of the charter , a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the `` special ' ' united nations ' budgets , and of course cannot be expelled from the organization ( which you suggested in your editorial ) , due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for expulsion .	30.416172
connally amendment ' s repeal held step toward world order	2360.8972
in your sept . 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh congress you referred to the lack of `` consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril ' ' .	36.06366
yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country ' s domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute of the international court of justice .	23.08121
the connally amendment says that the united states , rather than the court , shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party .	55.02125
if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic , the court has no jurisdiction .	47.24854
since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states , it also prevents us from using the court effectively .	54.67169
yet although the kennedy administration , and the eisenhower administration before it , have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment , as contrary to our best interests , no action has yet been taken .	47.189957
our `` destiny ' ' in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace , with justice , under law .	63.513092
to achieve this destiny , acts as well as words are needed -- not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect .	225.49709
what better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the connally amendment -- an act which could expose the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court , enable us to utilize it , and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order ? ?	70.45017
we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the eighty-seventh congress should have included repeal by the senate of the connally amendment .	14.223792
many home-bound subway riders utilizing the flushing-main street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their express comes to a stop , leaving them stranded and strained .	61.058014
to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventy-fourth street and change for the ind , this takes a daily toll of time and temper .	64.88469
the transit authority has recently placed in operation `` hold ' ' lights at bmt thirty-ninth and fifty-ninth street stations in brooklyn .	28.049526
this `` holds ' ' the local until the express passengers change trains .	202.26021
without question , this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the woodside station .	17.637589
as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly , from three to four hours a day .	76.67928
in the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service .	37.30813
it has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing .	72.36758
however , there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators .	51.125847
i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls , special long-distance calls , etc . .	10.426807
either it is lack of training , lack of proper screening when hiring , lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company , which does have a government-blessed monopoly .	33.29471
i disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled .	18.378649
the funeral for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price , far less than i had expected to pay .	45.9231
recently i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children .	5.9835286
hazel park donates its recreation center , five days a week , to the school .	26.07244
there is no charge and no state aid .	4.650785
kiwanis , american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support .	63.078773
there are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school .	44.012676
reading , writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass .	45.774754
enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon .	23.550932
southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus ( the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat ) .	101.1356
the school is located at 9-1/2 mile road , woodward heights .	4.721018
visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do .	24.905895
i was surprised at mayor miriani ' s defeat , but perhaps mayor-elect cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago .	41.860294
maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare , dpw and sanitation .	24.41924
negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great .	58.15558
he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night .	19.946661
there should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling .	69.611046
our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case .	54.629112
drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out .	8.931013
educate the city employes to give real service to the public .	6.3878465
after all , they are paid by the public , they should be examples .	107.784134
at a recent meeting of the women ' s association of the trumbull ave . united presbyterian church , considerable use was made of material from the detroit news on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english bible .	42.07678
some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration , the daily prayer and three minutes a day , as being very helpful .	55.035843
we feel that the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines .	48.84209
thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence .	12.202654
how old do you have to be to remember when americans , especially children , were encouraged to be polite ? ?	84.80794
why has this form of gentility gone out of american life ? ?	29.568691
how can we old-fashioned parents , who still feel that adults are due some respect from children , battle the new type of advertising that appears on tv without denying the children the use of television entirely ? ?	117.61022
writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of `` modern ' ' parents they have observed .	56.441006
from necessity , they are also inspired by the `` hard-sell ' ' attitude of the sponsor , so , finally , it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising .	41.602238
i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area .	15.51805
i just wish to congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles .	102.796715
we have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shopping in center city .	32.24609
maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a `` ghost ' ' town .	36.170124
i worked on the schuylkill expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldn ' t be an expressway .	65.90937
without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future .	121.69152
mr . george hough ( oct . 30 ) sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop .	68.03231
the trucks today help pay for this highway .	4.8597064
they try to keep within the speed limits .	5.0009937
although today ' s trucks are as fast as passenger cars , a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road .	30.035828
the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter `` simpleton ' ' instead of `` simplicitude ' ' .	35.84718
such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden .	124.0534
there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates , but not for the dropouts .	15.917067
what we need is more vocational training in high schools , not more dropouts .	33.34452
i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ! !	52.910458
i am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is .	133.45102
will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children ? ?	54.19696
if an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it .	70.09548
as i see it , if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back , the nuclear weapons we now have -- at least the bombs -- can inflict all the demage that is necessary .	44.19653
why do we need bigger and better bombs ? ?	6.9350815
i repeat , two wrongs do not make a right .	36.210236
everyone should take time to read martin luther ' s hymn `` a mighty fortress is our god ' ' .	19.404078
to our everlasting shame , we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki .	20.629978
having led the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race .	36.530933
are we to be the master of the atom , or will the atom be our master -- and destroy us ! !	113.960594
just because cheddi jagan , new boss of british guiana , was educated in the united states is no reason to think he isn ' t a red .	28.069094
we have quite a few home-grown specimens of our own .	26.388151
if we go all gooey over this newest castro ( until he proves he isn ' t ) we ' ve got rocks in our heads .	39.44304
how many times must we get burned before we learn ? ?	33.393215
just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one .	94.986496
the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides .	88.66525
intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan , london or pearl harbor .	60.122005
that is why the united nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war .	122.10963
russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world .	31.476128
why aren ' t the soviets expelled from the u . n . ? ?	6.241622
while `` better late than never ' ' may have certain merits , the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation .	25.8342
had it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations was living , unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and , in many ways , thankless task .	41.72426
according to one report , however , mr . hammarskjold was considered `` too controversial ' ' a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring .	27.344692
actually , of course , that label `` controversial ' ' applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet union .	66.189224
at khrushchev ' s door , therefore , can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated .	54.28698
it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed .	57.900238
as has happened so often in the past , the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy .	24.67914
just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for providing a first-class example of `` people to people ' ' good will .	26.03085
if only this could be done more often -- with such heartening results -- many of the earth ' s `` big problems ' ' would shrink to the insignificances they really are .	54.05775
thanks for your good coverage of ahmad ' s visit , too ! !	68.533195
your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable	111.388405
one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea .	80.83957
we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice .	65.58714
they start on the east side of the schuylkill , have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination .	54.695736
bridges , tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings .	50.872246
each one of these is , by its nature , a focal point or a point of natural congestion .	39.141384
we should avoid these congestion points or , putting it another way , keep cars starting and ending on the east side of the river -- on the east side .	54.793785
this can be accomplished by several logical steps ( 1 )	25.9216
widen the east river drive at least one lane .	99.68199
so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems .	94.86324
paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges .	50.999916
one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent .	80.70573
this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive .	24.002775
i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square 1 .	80.023315
replace it with the statue of one or another of the world ' s famous dictators .	8.960641
there ' s no sense in being reminded of times that were .	338.07266
washington square seems not part of a free land .	16.932775
it may remind one of russia , china or east berlin	74.68877
but it can ' t remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for .	79.52966
the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals , because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square .	62.800117
the matter may seem a small thing to some people , i know , but it ' s a very good start on the road to totalitarianism the commission has posted signs in washington square saying	49.692356
the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square .	39.596134
does each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance ? ?	60.426834
if birds don ' t belong in a square or park , what does ? ?	97.869156
they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature .	97.52699
but the commission does not share such sentiments .	4.3262877
the whole official city apparently has an intense hatred toward birds .	56.997524
starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon , from city hall .	85.2404
if any are left , presently , we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too .	106.076775
the city government is not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives .	7.6324883
let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe , lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive .	45.22253
of course , in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we ' re afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say , `` how come ? ?	50.035072
who wants this deed done ' ' ? ?	1.0153152
-- in this small way do the leaders of a city , or of a nation , inure the masses to watching , or even inflicting , torture and death , upon even their fellow men .	45.53098
one means to help the birds occurs to me let the chimes that ring over washington square twice daily , discontinue any piece of music but one .	118.79032
let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began , the hymn `` abide with me ' ' .	46.131138
we will know , and he will know , to whom it is rendered , what the birds would ask	60.940712
there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans are too `` soft ' ' .	23.139143
unfortunately , those who would remedy our `` softness ' ' seek to do so with calisthenics .	14.438544
they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy .	7.1648808
it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft .	100.18762
ashamed of our wealth and power , afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace , we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies .	68.18407
when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right , when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination , when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation , when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war , and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom , then , and only then will we no longer be `` soft ' ' .	59.647846
america doesn ' t need to `` push-up ' ' , she needs to stand up ! !	24.501925
the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals , is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit .	41.210094
however , he states unequivocally `` the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor ' ' .	41.60165
i must , in fairness , take issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals .	51.875885
the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan hearings had to do with `` sweetheart contracts ' ' .	24.957865
these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes .	57.440483
a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute .	128.93825
anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders .	45.759354
further , it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the landrum-griffin act .	43.825336
the nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet .	57.672474
it is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories .	50.202915
they predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting .	23.64101
the biggest nuclear device the united states has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our b-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece .	42.556885
some time ago , however , mr . khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the soviet union would make them .	52.471012
he seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock .	58.391518
and now , of course , the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side .	31.539946
khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb ? ?	1.0348096
so be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing .	80.39193
so escalation proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds .	47.414867
what is needed , philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun ( october 26 ) is a discontinuity .	36.418045
the escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon .	286.39923
`` only a discontinuity can end it ' ' , professor morrison writes .	15.663698
`` the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy ' ' .	71.87076
morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red china , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- europe of course must be written off out of hand .	43.049644
he feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take .	64.071396
his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon , governor rockefeller , past chairmen strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission , dr . edward teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war .	21.123245
these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale , all in the name of national security .	49.665577
capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation ' s security are incapable of learning , or even of observing .	43.44467
if this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation .	30.111694
he has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges .	28.33625
but if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously .	33.810963
not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere .	61.80892
khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps .	44.80689
when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural .	56.83298
thus , when the russians sent up their first sputnik , american chagrin was human enough , and american determination to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable .	96.03205
but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly .	19.955532
when east germans fled to the west by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of western publicists .	31.589577
they are less vocal now , when it is the west berliners who are migrating .	25.191154
the flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic .	106.898544
west berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable .	116.89836
nearly 18 per cent of west berlin ' s 2 , 200 , 000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12 . 8 per cent are under fifteen .	30.190016
r . h . s . crossman , m . p . , writing in the manchester guardian , states that departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1 , 700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1 , 900 a week .	39.19312
the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people .	239.86671
whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead .	148.92087
the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from west germany , but the hard truth , says crossman , is that `` the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german , as distinct from russian , troops was a major communist victory , which dealt west berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow .	78.54557
the gallant half-city is dying on its feet ' ' .	6.7334285
another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer ( london ) .	23.494804
mark arnold-foster writes `` people are leaving ( west berlin ) because they think it is dying .	39.01751
they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german employers ' federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six months ' front-line work in factories in west berlin .	52.59299
berlin ' s resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed ' ' .	95.59218
the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city .	33.69202
state department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into east berlin under military escort , will not avail .	71.131226
tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful .	30.881002
the materials for compromise are at hand the nation , walter lippmann and other sober commentators ( see alan clark on p . 367 ) have spelled them out again and again .	45.503494
a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save berlin .	49.858036
or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence , if that is what the west wants .	49.743244
the removal of stalin ' s body from the mausoleum he shared with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history .	36.0459
it is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead .	7.9056883
a british writer , richard haestier , in a book , dead men tell tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry 4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob .	57.92589
and in england , after the restoration , the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at tyburn .	9.08429
the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows .	12.68098
contemplating these posthumous punishments , stalin should not lose all hope .	51.122227
in 1899 , parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster , facing whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands .	33.14745
nikita khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself .	100.34583
the lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplores waste .	34.018097
who will take stalin ' s place beside lenin ? ?	5.179851
there is karl marx , of course , buried in london .	123.28649
the macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the soviet morticians could not make him look presentable .	27.294954
who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin ? ?	26.472794
since he has just shown who is top dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people .	42.070156
besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life .	26.25861
suppose he did lie beside lenin , would it be permanent ? ?	22.55672
if some future khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? ?	23.836355
when a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put .	73.119965
if nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand .	58.57979
the appointment of u thant of burma as the u . n . ' s acting secretary general -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .	51.504944
mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland were early favorites in the running , but france didn ' t like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter .	51.353085
with the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed mr . hammarskjold , u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto .	33.746826
what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy .	85.68787
in all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat .	148.33852
he has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future .	12.691305
he is a buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung .	18.829325
u thant of course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when mr . hammarskjold ' s term would have come to an end .	22.588974
whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen .	141.70667
mr . khrushchev ' s demand for a troika is dormant , not dead	52.464733
the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that u thant represents .	27.225307
in a sense , the showdown promised by mr . hammarskjold ' s sudden and tragic death has been avoided	15.568394
structurally , the u . n . is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it .	77.87392
but at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been proved wrong .	70.34826
no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade .	45.662933
these are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it , as messrs . salsich and engh report on page 372 .	35.819714
even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ?	86.570404
) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading .	66.631294
friends , a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at foley , alabama .	22.27949
`` if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast ' ' , the account reads , `` they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls .	57.075256
heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving civil defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute ' s notice ' ' .	62.286182
according to friends , the unit was organized by john snook , a former world war 2 , commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company .	12.826962
the girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck	22.934067
they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies ' accessories .	19.531582
this may be opera bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy .	73.222466
the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .	79.200874
the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms	38.23729
a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined .	3.050668
as the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real .	76.76412
soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst .	126.755905
all false gods resemble moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice .	30.097864
but there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands .	17.344824
the annual butchery of 40 , 000 american men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive	20.44758
a quota of 25 , 000 a year would be more than sufficient .	49.739933
no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace .	95.78523
if the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25 , 000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states .	60.42104
but by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily .	59.423916
yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical .	60.73335
here , then , is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning .	58.401016
from next new year ' s day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication .	59.39151
to avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse	56.12799
but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners .	68.357056
then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on july 4 , 1963 .	46.29455
the scene , of course , should be nine miles northwest of centralia , illinois , the geographical center of population according to the census .	35.84142
a special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois , should be erected for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized .	44.1698
the band should play the rogues ' march as a processional , switching to `` hail columbia , happy land ' ' ! !	18.934252
independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of which is life , and when any government becomes subversive of that end , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it .	68.432556
the highway system is an agency of government , and when it grinds up 40 , 000 americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers , which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do .	61.431442
hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better .	43.067955
moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at least partially , and perhaps primarily social .	142.4606
it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices -- for instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as it is generally termed , staying put .	47.850784
true , the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , `` home-keeping hearts are happiest ' ' , is as disreputable as socinianism .	22.431843
nonetheless , although few in number they are a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists , which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith .	52.124657
perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia , robert ruark ' s grandfather , who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is `` all this gallivantin ' ' ' .	15.940845
in any event , the yearly sacrifice of 40 , 000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith .	54.448902
somehow our contemporary moloch must be induced to see reason .	377.74628
since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have had such small effect , perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example .	100.31665
if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive , say beyond 25 , 000 per annum , then somebody is going to hang , it follows that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson .	63.426018
to hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways	33.027683
so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected .	13.156031
as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race .	21.394253
but the guilt is shared by the united states , britain and france , the other members of the atomic club .	21.252924
until moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 , the us and uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down .	80.71023
as it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body	26.534517
for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies .	15.277185
the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations .	62.696682
so , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr . khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat .	50.766357
shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions	34.29829
on october 19 , after the soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices , ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country , in `` self protection ' ' , might have to resume above-ground tests .	37.665844
more recently , the chairman of the atomic energy commission , dr . glenn t . seaborg , `` admitted ' ' to a news conference in las vegas , nevada , that the us might fall behind russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain .	30.913357
all of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood .	43.98709
but for the average citizen , unfortunately , this is one of science ' s worst-marked channels , full of tricky currents and unknown depths .	53.244728
the scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the most vital points , at least publicly .	44.035088
on the one hand , the public health service declared as recently as october 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots `` do not warrant undue public concern ' ' or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the aj .	78.46905
but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states ' ' .	27.632414
then it added `` it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected ' ' .	84.84333
having hedged its bets in this way , phs apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all `` at present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected ' ' .	105.69763
then , to conclude on an indeterminate note `` nevertheless , if fallout increased substantially , or remained high for a long time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world ' ' .	72.97398
dr . linus pauling , a nobel prize winner in chemistry , has been less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not .	41.185253
after declaring , in an article last month in frontier magazine , that the russian testing `` carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world ' ' , he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled 200 megatons	31.404121
the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160 , 000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects .	58.777245
long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200 , 000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia .	76.19791
most of these would be in the northern hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating .	27.021852
pauling ' s estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility .	37.54084
the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn .	67.66213
but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem .	51.63569
its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing .	154.8289
an illustration of this attitude is found in john a . mccone ' s letter to dr . thomas lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic .	35.36656
to this day the atomic energy commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout .	32.74735
a recent study on radiation exposure by the aec ' s division of biology and medicine stated `` the question of the biological effect of ( radiation ) doses is not considered ' ' herein .	41.60282
of course , the aec is in a bind now .	70.60148
if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests .	39.40996
so the commission ' s announcements of the new soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague .	30.136108
now , of course , that the russians are the nuclear villains , radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid , when the us was testing in the atmosphere .	56.127052
the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if not exactly good for you , might not be much worse than a bad cold .	107.57193
after a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof .	26.513416
yet if washington gets too indignant about soviet fallout , it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count .	87.930504
as of october 25 , the aec had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of tnt )	30.412632
and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported .	78.34993
assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons .	82.0733
some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50-megaton bomb that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated .	44.68129
if the new soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian tests , the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion , meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far .	69.63173
to this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in november , 1958 .	10.16097
one of the inescapable realities of the cold war is that it has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas .	79.26389
the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself .	37.66792
that dilemma is as much with us as ever .	60.499718
the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests .	34.206856
when this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late ' 50 ' s -- the united states appeared to have three choices .	63.8736
it could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations .	14.871012
it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination .	28.629124
or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security .	97.29284
with the resumption of soviet testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken .	56.068928
once again , the united states must choose .	66.49256
and once again , the choices are much the same .	14.504396
only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder .	62.48171
the first choice , abandoning tests entirely , would not only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploited by the russians .	18.890957
the second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere .	49.77205
the third choice , negotiation , presupposes , as russian behavior demonstrates , a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable .	43.86439
we take the position , however , that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us .	102.63038
it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable .	145.33606
its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice	395.9757
one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience .	43.551228
leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral , the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice .	58.936707
for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent americans are now proposing .	28.407778
in particular , governor nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests .	19.021034
speaking recently in miami , governor rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests ' ' .	20.316359
taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argued that the responsibility of the united states is `` to do , confidently and firmly , not what is popular , but what is right ' ' .	37.529358
what was missing in the governor ' s argument , as in so many similar arguments , was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right .	67.47143
the possibility , as he asserted , that the russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless , of course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand .	87.54235
besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governor ' s case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary .	52.988247
recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have , to the contrary , assured us that our lead is very great .	74.03633
unless the administration and the defense department have been deceiving us , the facts do not support the assertion that we are `` compelled ' ' to resume atmospheric testing .	15.368725
it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in the future , be necessary and even justifiable .	44.560486
but a resumption does not seem justifiable now .	23.600672
what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations .	96.51292
we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake .	68.06819
this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism .	51.31571
too often in the past russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part .	59.74343
there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia does .	40.77209
the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start .	21.673418
when his holiness pope john 23 , first called for an ecumenical council , and at the same time voiced his yearning for christian unity , the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate .	34.30386
with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom .	86.73163
but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became known , there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides .	56.803688
the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church .	24.892847
as it has turned out , however , the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses .	71.24576
two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy .	180.66048
first of all , it is now known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity .	47.971584
far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the pontiff believes that a revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism in the best possible light .	62.22657
equally significant , pope john has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity .	175.12679
a major aim of the council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity .	54.08486
secondly , a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the church .	81.27009
the establishment , by the holy father , of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern .	36.53999
the designation of five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches assembly in new delhi as `` official ' ' observers reverses the church ' s earlier stand .	45.77751
the public appeal by the new vatican secretary of state , cardinal cicognani , for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion was still another remarkable act .	32.91007
nor can one forget pope john ' s unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury .	19.869518
augustin cardinal bea , the director of the secretariate for christian unity , has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the church ' s stance toward the protestant and orthodox churches .	26.19511
noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion , he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone .	22.193186
for discouragement , or the temptation to abandon our efforts , `` would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of god , the irresistible efficacy of prayer , the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit ' ' .	44.56039
can any christian fail to respond to these words ? ?	16.826967
the administration ' s official budget review , which estimates a 6 . 9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year , isn ' t making anyone happy .	35.246643
certainly it isn ' t making the president happy , and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition , how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year .	51.6269
we sympathize with mr . kennedy , but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn ' t please us either , although for very different reasons .	76.11221
furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring .	41.829338
in the first place , a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhower ' s estimate of a 1 . 5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing president ' s farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor .	22.8283
the eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received .	81.2602
the rest of the deficit is also easily understood .	3.8476145
four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense , an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower administration , quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere .	40.55411
four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program , a responsibility similarly neglected by mr . eisenhower .	55.985546
the farm program will cost an additional 1 . 5 billion , because of unusual weather factors , the food for peace program and other new measures .	63.459263
anti-recession programs -- aid for the unemployed , their children and for depressed areas -- account for only 900 million of the 6 . 9 billion dollar deficit .	50.31506
our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small , most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures .	150.39378
and yet mr . kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening up ' ' and `` economizing ' ' .	8.2053795
we wish the president would remember that `` fiscal responsibility ' ' was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election .	50.3389
the party that won used to say something about a new frontier .	16.856224
introduction of the `` dialogue ' ' principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october .	55.665554
two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent protestants , and when the speaker was a catholic , one `` discussant ' ' on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion .	29.087122
sessions devoted to `` ethics and foreign policy trends ' ' , `` moral principle and political judgment ' ' , `` christian ethics in the cold war ' ' and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves .	55.291016
usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-catholic speaker or discussion leader .	53.826744
in the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law , which dr . william v . o ' brien of georgetown university , advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy .	35.71878
that aristotelean-thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants , but in the end the concept came to reassert itself .	37.64954
speakers declared that protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name .	56.102783
a lebanese moslem told about its existence and application in the islamic tradition as the `` divine law ' ' , while a c . a . i . p . member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new u . n . nations told of its widespread recognition on the african continent .	45.177692
the impression was unmistakable that , whatever one may choose to call it , natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence .	52.56799
another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself .	12.57488
the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable .	49.384388
it was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other ' s positions and better comprehension of one ' s own .	41.823734
but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed , and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues .	107.9407
one effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical ' ' atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend berlin , for example	37.969524
the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account	156.0129
it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian imperative .	76.02802
everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question .	32.69629
i was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy .	78.34418
i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts .	172.35367
but i questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian ' s dreamy irredentism .	10.254304
their answer was it can be done , and we will do it .	19.423792
and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang kai-shek `` in america ' ' , i said , `` practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland .	19.935593
what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done ' ' ? ?	35.651978
( he always smiles -- at least at visitors , i gather .	86.801956
he smiled also at a british bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions .	31.2653
i recalled sympathetically the duke ' s complaint in browning ' s `` my last duchess ' ' .	15.467634
) he smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned to me , `` the president wonders where you are going after you leave taipei ' ' ? ?	47.830894
that , i smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one .	64.097275
i answered the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly .	29.690174
chiang spoke again , this time at greater length .	18.306175
`` the president says ' ' , the translator came in , `` that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia , and that everywhere you went , you would seek the answer to your question .	100.747986
he says that if he were to express to you , once again , his own profound determination to go to the mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant .	83.66368
so you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions .	39.01911
any information we have here in taiwan is at your disposal ' ' .	10.961717
for every person on taiwan , there are sixty in mainland china .	46.488457
if the raw population figures are crucially relevant , then it is idle to think of liberation , as idle as to suppose that poland might liberate russia .	71.464325
less than 60-1 , but at least 6-1 .	6.2937093
the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army .	20.849564
the armed forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about 450 , 000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated .	60.4658
it is generally conceded that the formosan air force is the best by far in asia , and the army the best trained .	76.50197
even so , it adds up to impossible odds , except that the question arises , on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight ? ?	112.37777
the miserable people of china , the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play , cannot themselves resist overtly .	59.130123
they think , perforce , of physical survival everything else is secondary .	220.27934
but the army which mao continues to feed well , where are its sympathies ? ?	74.074684
the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in china over thousands of years .	93.07692
it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist depersonalization .	50.730293
every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close to starvation .	27.594143
the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed but will their discontent spread to the officer class ? ?	121.7621
the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed a despot does not economize on his generals .	19.887592
but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews .	4.303486
to whom will the generals stay loyal ? ?	1.0611955
there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in place of ideological purity out on the farm .	142.4805
it is another question whether `` they ' ' -- or a single general , off in a corner of china , secure for a few ( galvanizing ? ?	51.93532
) days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the party .	67.658745
but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there .	33.919254
the military in taiwan believe that the communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .	61.817207
the first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .	31.026993
and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .	80.216705
for it is the family that , in china , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .	38.53585
but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .	36.38216
thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .	33.276653
tibet has historically served china as a buffer state .	88.34511
a friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile .	50.502598
china never tried to integrate tibet by extirpating the people ' s religion and institutions .	30.528418
red china is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed .	34.616325
tibet is too vast , the terrain is too difficult .	39.158577
tibet may bleed china as algeria is bleeding france .	69.73586
these continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are doing much to keep china in a heightening state of tension .	69.58314
the imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from the outside , might cause it to snap .	84.28076
the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men .	55.156456
they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control .	137.64696
first and foremost , they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime .	4.4575415
secondly , they depend on america ' s `` moral cooperation ' ' when the crucial moment arrives .	34.835766
they hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly .	61.23085
i remarked jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd day .	38.216183
he affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point .	152.2086
but he -- and all of china -- wears the scars of american indecisiveness , and he knows what an uncertain ally we are .	27.996798
we have been grand to formosa itself -- lots of aid , and , most of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands .	48.291378
but our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive .	69.28093
a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr . kennedy ' s views on the world struggle .	18.207216
the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike .	37.53174
there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation .	63.795555
the moment of truth is the moment of crisis .	10.492458
during the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures .	46.529633
there the truth is , open to eyes that are willing to look .	31.388891
new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones .	6.176628
a truth-revealing crisis erupted in katanga for a couple of days this month , to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies .	54.343517
before memory , too , clouds over , let us make a note or two of what could be seen .	53.15726
the measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels .	93.403435
one knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine .	52.352974
but i am here concerned more with policy than with men .	53.45213
public men come and go but great issues of policy remain .	129.32542
now , everyone knows -- or knew in the week of december 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy .	98.32416
the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved .	38.63699
of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations .	4.378067
but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the u . s . was in reality the principal .	43.035152
the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato allies , to the entire western community .	41.92637
by our policy the west was -- is -- split .	113.0332
the controlling pattern was first displayed in the hungary-suez crisis of november 1956 .	60.136253
it reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality in cuba last spring ( with which the dominican events of last month should be paired )	115.359245
at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles	21.540031
in relation to laos , algeria , south africa	2.025255
right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana .	13.367378
this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows under prevailing policy , the u . s . can take the initiative against the right , but cannot take the initiative against the left .	36.127686
it makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue .	125.018906
the u . s . cannot take the initiative against the left .	30.44716
there is even some question whether the u . s . can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left .	44.96693
we can attack tshombe , but not gigenza .	42.56499
no matter that gizenga is moscow ' s man in the congo .	36.491062
no matter that it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men .	137.55182
no matter that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western interests in africa .	18.078138
( even granted that the congo should be unified , you don ' t protect western security by first removing the pro-western weight from the power equilibrium .	154.63472
we can force britain and france out of the suez , but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest .	67.283356
we can mass our fleet against the trujillos , but not against the castros .	19.134392
we can vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola , but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall -- much less , give the simple order to push the wall down .	47.007168
we officially receive the anti-french , moscow-allied algerian fln , but we denounce the pro-europe , anti-communist oas as criminal .	7.629192
in the very week of our war against katanga , we make a $133 million grant to kwame nkrumah , who has just declared his solidarity with the communist bloc , and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship .	21.65329
as our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-western katangans , we stand supinely bleating while nehru ' s troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our nato ally , portugal .	25.526575
it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy .	114.69727
the suez-hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration , but only made more consistent and more active .	91.013626
most immediately relevant to these episodes in goa , katanga and ghana , as to the suez-hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of asia , africa and latin america .	22.686533
from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the `` uncommitted ' ' ( `` neutralist ' ' , `` contested ' ' ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- nehru , tito , nkrumah , sukarno , betancourt , etc . .	19.451063
our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes .	30.240551
if we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible .	117.004486
and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the left .	58.314194
to write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it .	67.04978
nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else ' s book .	123.99473
to get started , he does not scan the world about him	267.55112
he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists .	9.719227
so far this season , broadway ' s premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original american stage plays .	64.46387
of straight dramas , there are all the way home , which owes much of its poetic power to the james agee novel , a death in the family	46.606373
the wall , awkwardly based on the john hersey novel	7.062745
advise and consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller	44.853172
face of a hero ( closed ) , based on a pierre boulle novel .	29.17318
the only original works attempting to reach any stature tennessee williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , period of adjustment , and arthur laurents ' clever but empty invitation to a march .	85.25719
clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- a taste of honey , by britain ' s young ( 19 when she wrote it ) shelagh delaney	34.06575
the hostage ( closed ) , by ireland ' s brendan behan .	7.0463777
among the musicals , camelot came from t . h . white ' s the once and future king , and novels were the sources of the less than momentous tenderloin and do re mi .	52.3526
wildcat and the unsinkable molly brown were originals , but pretty bad , leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly french irma la douce .	34.31089
the only other works at least technically original were dreary farces -- send me no flowers ( closed ) , under the yum-yum tree , critic ' s choice .	38.252716
in the forthcoming the conquering hero and carnival , broadway is not even adapting books , but reconverting old movies ( hail the conquering hero and lili ) .	44.009552
originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad .	39.277515
some memorable plays have been drawn from books , notably life with father and diary of anne frank .	59.293377
and particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long been the rule , from die fledermaus and the merry widow to oklahoma ! and my fair lady .	73.73109
as critic walter kerr points out `` adaptations , so long as they are good , still qualify as creative ' ' .	61.675262
and other defenders invariably argue that , after all , shakespeare and moliere were adapters too .	57.63044
the difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world	122.92847
most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book , squeeze it dry of life , and add only one contribution of their own stage technique .	50.655647
the most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense -- producers cannot afford to take chances .	86.821625
off-broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original .	128.37372
laudably enough , it is offering classics and off-beat imports , but last week only one u . s . original was on the boards , robert d . hock ' s stunning civil war work , borak .	42.98717
the real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of u . s . playwrights .	23.577274
he `` come with me to the casbah ' ' .	1.5490183
she `` by subway or cab ' ' ? ?	4.6159205
that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan , as more and more new yorkers were discovering 29th street and eighth avenue , where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like arabian nights , grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american inpost of belly dancing .	45.462738
their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis .	43.560867
the belly boites , with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted ionic columns , heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek and turkish families .	32.162277
between performances , enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces .	44.357037
except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor , the people watch in calm absorption .	44.67644
small , shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time , using guitars , violins , and more alien instruments with names that would open sesame the oud , grandfather of the lute	32.592003
the darbuka , a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass	20.127323
the girls sit quietly with the musicians , wearing prim dresses or plain , secretarial shifts , until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem .	41.144367
if a dancer is good , she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny -- the continuum of mankind .	20.088669
but a great many of what variety calls the `` cooch terpers ' ' are considerably less cosmic than that .	24.557444
each dancer follows the ancient oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates , and , through breathing and muscle control , she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room .	28.987686
this is done at varying speeds , ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ) .	32.874924
the new york dancers are highly eclectic , varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations , back bends or floor crawls .	33.925205
the belly dance leaves more to the imagination .	8.828816
when a dancer does well , she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers ' costumes .	28.185463
with tips , the girls average between $150 and $200 a week , depending on basic salary .	35.13842
although they are forbidden to sit with the customers , the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks , and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy .	51.25352
all over the country , belly clubs have never been bigger , especially in detroit , boston and chicago , and even in small towns	49.312828
one of the best dancers , a turkish girl named semra , works at a roadhouse outside bristol , conn . .	24.86308
the girls are kept booked and moving by several agents , notably voluble , black-bearded murat somay , a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central abdomen .	10.321184
he can offer nine turkish girls , plans to import at least 15 more .	44.303295
but a great many of the dancers are more or less native .	111.60122
sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis , conducted by lebanese and syrians in the u . s . , where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs .	27.386774
as the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins , the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly .	33.30879
jemela ( surname gerby ) , 23 , seems hong kong oriental but has a spanish father and an indian mother , was born in america and educated at holy cross academy and textile high school , says she learned belly dancing at family picnics .	87.79086
serene ( mrs . wilson ) , 23 , was born in budapest and raised in manhattan .	32.510887
daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance , she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the new york casbah , with dark eyes and dark , waist-length hair , the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe , glimmering body .	28.439196
many belly dancers are married , but serene is one of the few who will admit it .	32.032585
marlene ( surname adamo ) , 25 , a brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from arabic friends in paris , now lives on manhattan ' s west side , is about the best belly dancer working the casbah , loves it so much that she dances on her day off .	70.07747
she has the small , highly developed body of a prime athlete , and holds in contempt the `` girls who just move sex ' ' .	82.32537
leila ( malia phillips ) , 25 , is a greenwich village painter of persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles .	36.115845
a graduate of hollywood high school , she likes to imagine herself , as she takes the floor , `` a village girl coming in to a festival ' ' .	25.11753
gloria ( surname ziraldo ) , circa 30 , who was born in italy and once did `` chorus work ' ' in toronto , has been around longer than most of the others , wistfully remembers the old days when `` we used to get the seamen from the ships , you know , with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all .	55.913837
but the ships are very slow now , and we don ' t get so many sailors any more ' ' .	24.876284
the uptown crowd has moved in , and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar ? ?	80.0366
of the handful of painters that austria has produced in the 20th century , only one , oskar kokoschka , is widely known in the u . s . .	11.931882
this state of unawareness may not last much longer .	9.694581
for ten years a small group of european and u . s . critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten austrian expressionist egon schiele , who died 42 years ago at the age of 28 .	13.335581
the critics ' campaign finally inspired the first major u . s . exhibit of schiele ' s works .	18.285181
the show has been to boston and manhattan , will in time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis .	106.073135
last week it opened at the j . b . speed museum in louisville , at the very moment that a second schiele exhibit was being made ready at the felix landau gallery in los angeles .	23.46711
schiele ' s paintings are anything but pleasant .	9.549545
his people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened .	9.859521
his colors are dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom .	12.682476
but he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time , and even after nearly half a century , the tense , tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination .	82.86146
the son of a railway stationmaster , schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town of tulln , 14 miles northwest of vienna .	24.207186
he was an emotional , lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork .	107.5809
when he was 15 , his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the academy of fine arts in vienna .	31.30702
even there he did not last for long .	4.0338655
cried one professor after a few months of student schiele ' s tantrums and rebellion `` the devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom ' ' ! !	43.600338
for a while his work was influenced deeply by the french impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of gustav klimt , then the dean of austrian art .	14.485963
gradually schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter .	46.713634
his pictures were roundly denounced as `` the most disgusting things one has ever seen in vienna ' ' .	34.78403
he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days -- the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle .	46.367382
for years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in vienna ' s gutters .	14.121003
drafted into the austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a vienna billet , went on painting .	25.961927
it was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show .	34.451874
the unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it was too much even for morbid-minded vienna .	64.86266
he was obsessed by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust .	23.63414
the children he painted were almost always in rags , his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness , and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic .	10.925565
the subject he liked most was the female body , which he painted in every state -- naked , half-dressed , muffled to the ears , sitting primly in a chair , lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace .	24.988255
the most surprising thing about the twenty-second congress of the soviet communist party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the twentieth congress of 1956 , which ended with that famous `` secret ' ' report on stalin .	38.888596
the publication last july of the party ' s draft program -- that blueprint for the `` transition to communism ' ' -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this twenty-second congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i . e . , since the defeat of the `` anti-party group ' ' ) in all theoretical party journals .	31.447657
these never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of marx and lenin `` full communism ' ' was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a communist society had now , under khrushchev , become an `` immediate and tangible reality ' ' .	87.750854
it seems that khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to marxist doctrine with his draft program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) .	79.35731
he and other soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas , such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` all people ' s state ' ' , and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater `` democratization ' ' of the whole hierarchy of soviets , starting with the supreme soviet itself .	63.91796
their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy ' ' and would enable `` the people ' ' to take a more direct and active part in running the country .	34.167408
there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from .	78.97747
no doubt , there was still a lot in the draft program -- and in khrushchev ' s speech -- which left many points obscure .	97.21729
was it the party ' s intention , for example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes , i . e . , state farms ( which were , moreover , to be progressively `` urbanized ' ' ) ? ?	29.554096
as we know , the soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot	52.061886
and it is still very far from certain how valid the party ' s claim is that in `` a growing number of kolkhozes ' ' the peasants are finding it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm .	51.414276
if one follows the reports of the congress , one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter .	68.16336
the draft program was interesting in other respects , too .	33.106964
it contained , for example , a number of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays	24.824827
they still benefit far less than the `` other ' ' 50 per cent of the nation from that `` welfare state ' ' which the soviet union so greatly prides itself on being .	46.81849
over all these fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly	48.53466
and , though he repeated , over and over again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the `` ordinary ' ' people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how `` communism ' ' is really going to work in practice , especially in respect of food .	58.12888
would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry ? ?	1.055587
this was something on which k . himself seemed to have some doubts	30.264042
for he kept on threatening that he would `` pull the ears ' ' of those responsible for agricultural production .	58.365185
and , as we know , the virgin lands are not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped .	93.45213
one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev ' s agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the `` anti-party group ' ' -- molotov , malenkov , kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old marshal voroshilov .	21.462307
molotov , in particular , is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services , to increase rents and fares	54.83605
in fact , with having been against all the more popular features of the khrushchev `` welfare state ' ' .	62.750427
the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story what , in the secret councils of the kremlin , molotov had really proposed , we just don ' t know , and he has had no chance to reply .	50.318554
but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party ' ' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism ' ' and , last but not least , on foreign policy .	50.233696
the whole problem of `` peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition ' ' with the capitalist world is in the very center of this congress .	33.7405
`` molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence , reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather , the absence of war at a given moment , and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war .	34.17434
his views , in fact , coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence , who look upon it merely as a variant of the `` cold war ' ' or of an `` armed peace ' ' .	36.039135
one cannot help wondering whether molotov and the rest of the `` anti-party group ' ' are not being used as china ' s whipping-boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers .	22.972254
for something , clearly , has gone very , very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese relations , which were never easy , and have now deteriorated .	103.78254
the effect of chou en-lai ' s clash with khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on molotov & co . , has shifted the whole attention of the world , including that of the soviet people , from the `` epoch-making ' ' twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese conflict .	28.980555
not only , as we know , did chou en-lai publicly treat khrushchev ' s attack on albania as `` something that we cannot consider as a serious marxist-leninist approach ' ' to the problem ( i . e . , as something thoroughly dictatorial and `` undemocratic ' ' ) , but the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to khrushchev , calling him a liar , a bully , and so on .	28.747658
it is extremely doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends .	45.561344
the big question is whether , in the name of a restored chinese-soviet solidarity , the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians to present their humble apologies to khrushchev -- or get rid of enver hoxa .	21.137924
these seem about the only two ways in which the `` unhappy incident ' ' can now be closed .	35.602753
but albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between china and russia .	54.950146
khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence ' ' and would like , above all , the berlin and german problems to be settled peacefully	50.502728
he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the russo-american `` honeymoon ' ' of 1959 .	21.037876
but it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from china , but perhaps also from that `` china lobby ' ' which , i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago , exists on the quiet inside the party .	84.05015
to these people , solidarity and unity with china should be the real basis of russia ' s future policy .	40.176266
and the chinese , as the albanian incident shows , have strong suspicions that khrushchev is anxious to secure a `` shameful ' ' peace with the west .	24.496208
the fact that china ( which is obsessed by formosa -- to khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by north korea and north vietnam is highly indicative .	44.545883
and one cannot but wonder whether marshal malinovsky , who was blowing hot and cold , exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the west , wasn ' t trying to keep the chinese quiet .	40.6099
and this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb .	86.28748
was not this dropped primarily in order to `` appease ' ' the chinese -- especially after `` khrushchev ' s `` humiliating ' ' surrender to the west in canceling the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31 ? ?	25.7168
what does it all add up to ? ?	1.0303637
indications are that khrushchev ( and , with him , the bulk of the soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of berlin ) the maintenance of the status quo in the world .	34.639336
the chinese , north vietnamese and north koreans , on the other hand , feel that , militarily , russia is strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation ' ' they would like to embark on before long with china attacking formosa and the north koreans and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries .	36.858173
perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 , when the `` anti-party group ' ' nearly liquidated him .	57.70859
he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition	27.839306
but if he is up against china ' s crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life .	27.234041
he may support china ( but he won ' t )	6.1707797
he may break with china ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ) , or he may succeed , by all kinds of dangerous concessions , in persuading china to be patient .	56.944687
the next days may show where things stand .	31.299492
on a misty sunday morning last month , a small band of militant anti-communists called the minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here .	33.875004
eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare .	43.45499
to the average american , this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie .	71.80437
but to the minutemen , this is a serious business .	121.69675
they feel that the united states is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy .	18.073666
they feel that world war 3 , has already begun , and they are setting themselves up as a `` last line of defense ' ' against the communist advance .	51.47807
their national leader , robert bolivar depugh of norborne , mo . , says the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the red onslaught .	16.051407
in their maneuvers last month , they wore world war 2 , camouflage garb and helmets , and carried unloaded m-1 rifles .	10.251261
the maneuvers were held `` in secret ' ' after a regional seminar for the minutemen , held in nearby shiloh , ill . , had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs , who had arrested regional leader richard lauchli of collinsville , ill . , and seized four operative weapons , including a browning machine gun , two browning automatic rifles and an m-4 rifle .	26.806927
undismayed by this contretemps , a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchli ' s home at 6 30 a . m . the next day , put on their uniforms , and headed for a farm several miles away .	22.425104
a 60 mm . mortar and a 57 mm . recoilless rifle owned by lauchli were brought along .	15.20214
the mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated .	4.793579
after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war 2 , army jeep down soggy trails , the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long , low ridge and a creek-filled gully .	37.18174
here the two leaders , depugh and lauchli , hastened to put the group through its paces .	51.633892
the minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment .	32.21192
they were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge .	14.787649
they practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades	6.8815775
and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment .	19.32892
eleven dummy rounds were fired by lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting .	13.326444
mrs . depugh , the mother of five children and an active member of her husband ' s organization , participated in all the exercises .	37.622826
there were no `` casualties ' ' , but the `` guerrillas ' ' admitted to being `` a little tired ' ' when the leaders called a halt at 9 a . m . to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane .	24.660507
i would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by russell kirk ( dec . 16 ) .	67.060005
it has to do with teachers ' salaries and tenure .	13.778647
next september , after receiving a degree from yale ' s master of arts in teaching program , i will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers .	66.758125
the amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers .	16.031862
as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfied with second-rate teachers .	40.081272
the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality .	40.44996
hence all teachers , good and bad , who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary .	41.49281
i am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country , the profession is grossly overpaid .	13.440298
it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases	476.34573
there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance .	25.582745
the only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them .	159.26105
the only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure .	46.689632
here , as in all sectors of the economy , quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses .	89.36211
on the eve of the `` great debate ' ' on the proposal to give the president broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the atlantic community , we should face the alternatives on this proposition .	32.177963
what we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate .	107.46267
without this power we lay open any american industry which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others .	74.20234
it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs .	39.80952
i disagree with mr . burnham ' s position on the common market ( nov . 18 ) as a desirable organization for us to join .	39.897526
for him to ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of this kind is difficult to understand .	50.892467
the pressure for our entry to the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare ' ' , or garden path , with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background .	64.83248
the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal , as well as economic , self-rule .	51.033314
in entering this union we will be surrendering most , if not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the atlantic institute ( recently set up ) or the o . e . c . d . , i . m . f . and others .	46.428013
to think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking .	84.8725
if it is not enough that all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join this market , i refer you to an article in the new york times ' magazine section ( nov . 12 , 1961 ) , by mr . eric johnston , entitled `` we must join the common market ' ' .	47.291782
he says `` it has swept aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs ' ' .	5.9292974
referring to britain , he says , `` we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy , placing this authority in continental hands ' ' .	169.72557
since the goal of our international planners is a world government , this atlantic community would mark a giant step in that direction for , once american economic autonomy is absorbed , a larger grouping is a question of time .	127.36765
frankly , it is being very cleverly done for , in a sense , they have us over a barrel .	70.09548
listen to what mr . johnston has to say `` consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict .	35.931026
we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need .	101.68867
we would be crippled by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment ' ' .	55.17279
but the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community or `` economic empire ' ' , but merely what libertarians like henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry .	36.170113
create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we ' ll compete with anyone , europe and asia combined .	60.205692
in short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won ' t have to worry about european competition or communism either .	71.56591
if we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it	28.533197
if we go into this common market , we might just as well stop talking about constitutional guarantees , connally amendments or , for that matter , conservatism in general .	114.94819
we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the atlantic common market which jnr will be continuing in our pages .	37.591434
the peiping chinese were the only major silver seller in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on monday morning , november 27 , anticipating by two days the announcement of the u . s . treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed .	23.999727
in 1954 i was drafted and after serving two years honorably on active duty i was not required to participate in any further army reserve activities .	83.61384
now , more than five years later , i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier .	258.08267
but , in spite of this , i , at present a man 31 years of age and a college professor , have been recalled `` by direction of the president ' ' to report on november 25th to fort devens , massachusetts , for another twelve months of active duty as an sp 4 ( the equivalent of a pfc ) .	41.68221
today , seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee , i am assistant professor of philosophy and science at st . michael ' s college .	21.216177
for , after leaving the army in 1956 , i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college and then at the university of toronto .	44.25796
this time , added to that which i had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 , makes a total of twenty-two ( 22 ) years of education .	61.10893
the possibility of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys .	65.8744
however , it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation `` to exercise its mandate reasonably , equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes ' ' .	58.88261
in my own case , i submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking .	90.03525
taken back into the army now as an sp 4 , i am leaving 110 college students whose teacher i am .	77.60165
( a wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes .	30.114603
) at this late date , it is impossible for st . michael ' s college to find a suitable replacement for me .	27.592005
even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- i cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone mad .	54.142788
in news broadcasts i consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the katanga army referred to as mercenaries .	47.698906
if the hessian troops sent here willy-nilly by the hessian government to fight for england in the 1770 ' s were mercenaries , what shall we call the un troops sent to the congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the united nations ? ?	19.816708
if the un troops are not mercenaries then the hessians were not mercenaries either .	25.318134
and if the foreigners fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then lafayette and von steuben were mercenaries too , as were also the members of the lafayette escadrille in the early part of world war 1 , and of chennault ' s flying tigers in the early days of world war 2 .	24.707418
it doesn ' t take a gore vidal to tell you what ' s wrong with cherokee textile ' s slogan ( pitney-bowes objects ' ' , july 1 ) .	24.361979
it ' s an eighteenth-century negative , man ! !	109.20343
suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment by moving the term `` republic ' ' to lower case , substituting the modern phrase , `` move ahead ' ' for the stodgy `` keep ' ' , and by using the postmaster ' s name on every envelope ( in caps , of course , with the `` in spite ' ' as faded as possible ) , the slogan cannot fail .	45.27942
in the issue of march 5 , 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said	340.934
`` on trial in jakarta for having flown for the indonesian anti-communist insurgents , u . s . pilot alan lawrence pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters , he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of indonesia .	29.664427
facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty , he said ' i have participated in the war against communism in korea and at dienbienphu , and i have helped in the evacuation of north vietnamese to the free world .	19.585712
i have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by communist domination .	52.90416
at least in indonesia , khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with communism ' ' ! !	112.682816
since then nothing has happened to save the life of pope .	20.883852
i found recently a very small article in the new york times	10.366933
indonesia court upholds pope ' s death sentence .	1.8722148
-- indonesia military supreme court has confirmed the death sentence passed on alan lawrence pope , an american pilot .	57.952747
pope was convicted last year of having aided north celebes rebels by flying bombing missions .	40.670643
he has been in prison since may , 1958 , when his aircraft was shot down over moluccas .	43.309875
he may appeal to president sukarno for clemency ' ' .	7.717021
as we see , pope may appeal to president sukarno , khrushchev ' s friend , for clemency .	18.434483
the eleanor roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban freedom fighters .	32.988525
but who will act now and immediately to save the life of alan pope ? ?	31.530682
does anybody think of saving the life of an anti-communist american pilot ? ?	41.64916
a few days before i saw your mention of what texas liberals were doing to promote `` louis capet ' ' ( the week ' ' , june 3 ) , another analogy had occurred to me .	51.043427
`` with no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will , he was the government ' ' .	85.77212
`` a ' dust-settling ' period of decadence and decline ' ' .	11.227163
`` he opened his mouth , said little , and thought not at all ' ' .	38.440147
`` not completely virtuous , but completely incompetent ' ' .	1.834225
truly , that liberals should choose louis 14 , as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic , considering the louis 14 , character of their grand monarque , fdr not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification , ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) , but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies .	26.792799
in defeating `` louis capet ' ' , john tower ' s victory in texas signals , once again , the end of the divine right of liberalism .	75.758736
it seems to me that n . c . , in his editorial `` confrontation ' ' ( sr , mar . 25 ) , has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer ? ?	32.10699
this affects us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress .	58.60717
i know of no other solution than the one n . c . proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us , hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place .	95.39642
never have i seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically .	59.47239
thank you for the illustrated editorial `` confrontation ' ' .	1.7222799
it is both great writing and profound religion .	4.403001
n . c . has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece .	88.19131
i feel that n . c . hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` confrontation ' ' .	14.551729
my only hope is that it will be shared by many , many others .	233.70879
`` confrontation ' ' should fortify us all , whether in southeast asia or the u . s . .	18.159876
congratulations to n . c . for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the peace corps .	25.814049
i concur that it is necessary for americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands .	66.01168
it would be heartbreaking to see idealism , and hence effective leadership , thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run into .	95.59541
the editorial `` confrontation ' ' was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in america .	71.18297
thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world .	87.011314
n . c . ' s editorial `` confrontation ' ' is a stunning piece of writing .	18.46446
i would hope that sargent shriver will encourage everyone entering the peace corps to read it .	34.40169
the important people to humanity are not the khrushchevs and the castros but the schweitzers and the dooleys , and the others like them whose names we will never know .	34.529305
editor ' s note reprints of `` confrontation ' ' will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the peace corps .	29.123276
a peace corps official described the editorial as `` precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers ' ' .	36.715054
f . l . lucas ' s article in sr ' s april 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the new english bible .	32.47693
i certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers , rather than the comment by cleveland amory in his first of the month column .	48.28416
it is blind , fundamentalist dogmatism to say , `` messing around with the king james version seems to us a perilous sport at best ' ' .	37.653416
lester markel is on the right track in his article `` interpretation of interpretation ' ' ( sr , mar . 11 ) .	11.816614
the current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact , fancy , and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago .	76.11649
we don ' t need this type of protection any more .	220.20857
the public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media .	197.44113
besides , there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about .	26.707827
the accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities .	10.338439
a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute , for instance , is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute .	41.01848
second , it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous .	38.86384
the charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation .	167.03807
yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns .	98.151024
despite several years of front-page stories , the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating .	73.72114
the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions .	64.61146
it seems to me the time has come for the american press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends .	62.018475
the objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors .	78.59034
i would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning president kennedy ' s activities , so far as southern california is concerned .	64.52352
you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions .	57.443794
to begin with , the all-powerful los angeles times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences .	29.658537
i am sure that they did when eisenhower was president .	128.3077
next , because of the time differential , the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day .	50.84005
up until now , the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 p . m . or sometimes 7 or 10 30 p . m . .	25.854763
even then , a few of the `` less interesting ' ' questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator .	27.314322
however , last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley and brinkley could squeeze into their programs .	64.4681
this is no criticism of them , as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary .	100.97264
the radio stations did run `` transcripts ' ' ( i thought ) during the evening hours .	56.341915
however , by comparing the tv snatches , two different radio station re-runs , and the censored los angeles times version , i found that the radio stations had edited out questions ( abc removed the one regarding laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president ' s answer .	54.111897
i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the `` abuse ' ' he is being subjected to .	63.404976
we out here don ' t see enough of the conference to know he is being abused .	61.44287
i don ' t know if this is the situation in other parts of the country	26.847176
it also happened with the inauguration , which was not re-run at all during the evening hours , and i wrote to the tv editor of the times .	25.232725
he did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations ' not doing this -- but nothing happened .	84.15257
can you bring the networks ' attention to this ? ?	10.749316
i was interested in james webb young ' s madison avenue column in which he raised the question `` do we need a college of propaganda ' ' ? ?	42.965057
and the sad part of it is that we had one , which was rounding into excellent shape , and we let it disintegrate and die .	66.83448
during the war , we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare , which included the teaching of propaganda , both black and white and the various shades of grey in between .	48.764492
we had a couple of schools in this country , the principal one being on the marshall field estate out in lloyd ' s neck .	69.756645
there were also a couple in canada , and several in england .	33.853546
the english schools preceded ours , and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching .	36.902576
four of us here in the united states attended , first as students , then as instructors , almost every one of these schools , in england , canada , and the united states .	39.84604
we set up the lloyd ' s neck school , worked out its curriculum , and taught there .	70.37037
toward the end of the war , we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it .	72.30211
when the end did come , and the schools were disbanded and abandoned , we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust .	49.40197
we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so .	185.84573
there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare .	7.360971
a study at the pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there .	72.03744
and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way .	60.789646
congratulations on the article `` do we need a college of propaganda ' ' ? ?	6.7462187
this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years , and i certainly hope it sparks some action .	90.86467
many of us in public relations were flattered that richard l . tobin chose to devote his editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger of the public relations society of america and the american public relations association .	40.61732
i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published .	78.08047
whether in his forthcoming book c . p . snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important .	58.405106
one should be able to get hold of the book at once .	56.825825
but the attack was made from an advance copy .	6.06059
if this practice should take root and spread , the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality .	56.153233
editor ' s note sir robert watson-watt wrote , on page 50 of sr research for 4 march 1961	129.52457
`` i have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled , ' science and government .	119.320045
until the work actually appears i am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail .	28.957687
but i have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of godkin lectures at harvard , from which the book was derived , and i can with confidence challenge the gist of c . p . snow ' s incautious tale ' ' .	32.91299
watson-watt ' s remarks in sr did not then , constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures .	30.277943
representatives of harvard university press , which is publishing the book this month of april , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book ' s publication date .	65.8337
the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt .	8.516271
sir robert watson-watt ' s `` rebuttal ' ' of sir charles snow ' s godkin lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself from sir charles ' supposed falsehoods while stating those `` falsehoods ' ' in an unclear incoherent argument .	45.984474
the article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning .	28.343813
it calls the conclusion admitted valid by `` historians and military strategists alike ' ' a `` perverted conclusion .	34.693867
it submits an enthusiastic , impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing another aspect of the man , but on no more authoritative basis than sir charles ' account .	90.657585
we are left to choose between the two lindemanns .	17.005716
the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party .	34.077057
but we are to believe that lindemann actively supported radar outside the tizard committee , and dissembling , discounted it inside ? ?	31.2731
if so , i would lean to sir charles ' conception of the man .	12.789353
i think it was a grave error to print the article at this time .	37.865932
to the unfortunate people unable to attend the godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it .	31.438742
it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the violin .	8.770178
certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless recitals , and where thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the chicago symphony orchestra , playing the brahms concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed .	40.039944
there was about that song something incandescent , for this brahms was milstein at white heat .	64.65673
not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent .	45.24453
those would be reserved for the orchestra ' s great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .	45.821156
this time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood .	103.427284
but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .	80.66275
that is , when mr . milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , mr . hendl could go along .	19.284014
but mr . hendl does not go straight to any point .	49.60302
there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion .	73.26864
so we had some dazzling and memorable milstein , but not great brahms .	24.346098
the concert opened with another big romantic score , schumann ' s overture to `` manfred ' ' , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the byronic point to keep it afloat .	16.86774
hindemith ' s joust with weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands transluscent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit .	16.435823
it got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style .	110.783806
the bayreuth festival opens july 23 with a new production of `` tannhaeuser ' ' staged by wieland wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by wolfgang sawallisch .	18.353483
sawalisch also conducts `` the flying dutch ' ' , opening july 24 .	14.528551
`` parsifal ' ' follows july 25 , with hans knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` die meistersinger ' ' , to be presented aug . 8 and 12 .	15.6825285
the `` ring ' ' cycles are july 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and aug . 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 .	17.60288
no casts are listed , but lotte lehmann sent word that the negro soprano , grace bumbry , will sing venus in `` tannhaeuser ' ' .	19.778576
remember how by a series of booking absurdities chicago missed seeing the bolshoi ballet ? ?	31.410194
remember how by lack of two big theaters chicago missed the first visit of the royal danish ballet ? ?	54.695866
well , now we have two big theaters .	5.5689235
but barring a miracle , and don ' t hold your breath for it , chicago will not see the leningrad-kirov ballet , which stems from the ballet cradle of the maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world .	35.12789
before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming , not once but several times , indeed we did .	311.26938
the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in mccormick place , which sol hurok , ballet booker extraordinary , considers the finest house of its kind in the country -- and of course he doesn ' t weep at the capacity , either .	43.732952
allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates as dec . 4 thru 10 .	15.991282
later the hurok office made it dec . 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory .	20.576971
but if you keep a calendar of events , as we do , you noticed a conflict .	80.817444
allied arts had booked marlene dietrich into mccormick place dec . 8 and 9 .	25.641195
allied arts then notified us that the kirov would cut short its los angeles booking , fly here to open nov . 28 , and close dec . 2 .	49.389675
a couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake ' ' .	41.88908
so i started making some calls of my own .	78.82614
the kirov ballet is firmly booked into the shrine auditorium , los angeles , nov . 21 thru dec . 4 .	6.495631
not a chance of opening here nov . 28 -- barring that miracle .	25.14565
then why not the juicy booking hurok had held for us ? ?	48.20307
well , dietrich won ' t budge from mccormick place .	21.92677
then how about the civic opera house ? ?	1.0079149
well , allied arts has booked lena horne there for a week starting dec . 4 .	41.140316
queried about the impasse , allied arts said `` better cancel the kirov for the time being .	39.770058
it ' s all up in the air again ' ' .	26.98087
so the kirov will fly back to russia , minus a chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country .	23.160576
paintings and drawings by marie moore of st . thomas , virgin islands , are shown thru nov . 5 at the meadows gallery , 3211 ellis av . , week days , 3 p . m . to 8 p . m . , sundays 3 p . m . to 6 p . m . , closed mondays .	16.277521
an exhibition of evelyn cibula ' s paintings will open with a reception nov . 5 at the evanston community center , 828 davis st . .	43.082172
abstractions and semi-abstractions by everett mcnear are being exhibited by the university gallery of notre dame until nov . 5 .	10.273815
in the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget , the dallas civic opera will use san francisco ' s new leni bauer-ecsy production of `` lucia di lammermoor ' ' this season , returning the favor next season when san francisco uses the dallas `` don giovanni ' ' , designed by franco zeffirelli .	29.965374
h e . bates has scribbled a farce called `` hark , hark , the lark ' ' ! !	5.759813
it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season .	32.773506
if there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find .	25.477127
perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics .	50.322437
anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions .	6.6316085
one is an imperial london stockbroker called jerebohm .	3.6247568
another is a wily countryman called larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , i believe , in earlier volumes of mr . bates ' comedie humaine .	24.603418
well , jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities .	22.58241
they want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor house , or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers .	67.38565
they are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at .	109.37655
and of course larkin has just the thing they want .	91.812744
the name of it is gore court , and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress t . s . eliot .	20.635843
that ' s not precisely the way larkin urges them to look at it , though .	59.67914
he conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air .	13.487936
he suggests that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor .	3.6795075
the stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform .	11.26187
the vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch .	146.93822
the spaciousness of the tudor cooking areas , for example , will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids .	52.45964
also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented .	39.435318
it ' s a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble larkin puts himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse .	43.7341
he doesn ' t really need the immense sum of money ( probably converted from american gold on the london exchange ) he makes them pay .	129.55429
for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot .	34.64537
he has a glorious wife and many children .	6.9340296
when he needs money to buy something like , say , the rolls-royce he keeps near his vegetable patch , he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies .	42.310413
one of those capital-gains ventures , in fact , has saddled him with gore court .	106.84651
he is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands .	47.634766
and the jerebohms are more than willing to buy it .	9.077833
they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox ' s life on earth .	34.543427
if , in larkin ' s eyes , they are nothing but piccadilly farmers , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living .	62.421196
mr . bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc .	128.95706
oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war .	184.06232
first the larkins are ahead , then the jerebohms .	28.958845
after larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers .	24.590376
one of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left over from kipling ' s tales of india , does not approve of the way larkin gets his birds .	53.471985
he doesn ' t think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting .	19.603363
but the brigadier dines on the birds with relish .	10.143683
it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from miguel de cervantes ' `` don quixote ' ' is the brilliant russian spectacle , done in wide screen and color , which opened yesterday at the fifty-fifth street and sixty-eighth street playhouses .	37.53656
more than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , sancho panza , in seventeenth-century spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character .	15.257071
nikolai cherkasov , the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander nevsky and ivan the terrible , performs the lanky don quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man .	40.22087
his addle-brained knight-errant , self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as cervantes no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues .	34.08276
cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do .	22.906744
he treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect .	14.575177
directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .	34.65111
the complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the russian dialogue .	30.57506
the voices of all the characters , including that of cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities .	34.498882
and the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed .	4.9296165
since russian was being spoken instead of spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here .	29.492035
splendid , too , is the performance of yuri tolubeyev , one of russia ' s leading comedians , as sancho panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire ' ' .	10.70456
though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness -- a sort of peasant dignity -- too .	40.574047
it is really as though the russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons .	101.65119
the episode in which sancho panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island ' ' is one of the best in the film .	33.29533
true , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half , before don quixote goes to the duke ' s court .	46.696823
but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy .	13.786457
there are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange .	52.931515
also on the bill at the fifty-fifth street is a nice ten-minute color film called `` sunday in greenwich village ' ' , a tour of the haunts and joints .	18.9672
television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family .	50.41219
there seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime evening time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary .	24.683771
at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` chicago and all that jazz ' ' , presented on nbc-tv nov . 26 .	31.776897
the program came out of the nbc special projects department , and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series .	57.33097
perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines .	4.481365
if so , it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents .	85.19433
as a matter of fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results .	67.81355
a few years ago a `` timex all-star jazz show ' ' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from lionel hampton ' s big band to the free-wheeling dukes of dixieland .	18.162167
an enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live ' ' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance .	51.23541
about that same time john crosby ' s tv series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do .	80.57453
in an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .	32.94341
the program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music .	43.960304
cameras stared at soloists ' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work .	71.27552
`` chicago and all that jazz ' ' could not be faulted on the choice of artists .	45.70289
some of the in-person performers were jack teagarden , gene krupa , bud freeman , pee wee russell , johnny st . cyr , joe sullivan , red allen , lil armstrong , blossom seeley .	9.510825
the jazz buff could hardly ask for more .	27.513702
furthermore , garry moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies .	14.262376
( he played host at the timex show already mentioned .	53.84465
one of the script ' s big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today .	91.39403
nbc had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share .	38.883
for example , there was sheet music with the word `` jazz ' ' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold .	60.989983
samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 ' s .	55.805958
however well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening ' s main business , which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the chicago style .	63.186157
another source of nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse .	24.173857
similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal .	83.941086
`` chicago and all that jazz ' ' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .	84.959435
by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today ' s artists , the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either .	23.74587
still , the network ' s willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated .	57.306812
even joan sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending her debut as lucia in donizetti ' s `` lucia di lammermoor ' ' sunday night .	19.227303
the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as miss sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic `` mad scene ' ' created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .	48.256897
her entrance in scene 2 , act 1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note .	80.483025
thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization .	73.01178
as she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` lucia ' ' .	39.964046
each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` mad scene ' ' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment .	26.730831
miss sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene a much more girlish lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role .	44.068382
what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today .	71.306625
this big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined .	36.50722
nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm up slowly .	62.886208
in the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently .	41.540775
technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic .	31.797426
many years have passed since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable .	879.77264
her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine .	97.72623
the performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , silvio varviso .	26.785013
he injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years .	51.31096
he may respect too much the italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers ' opera may be quite difficult .	63.49471
his bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction .	45.325928
the remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable .	134.38416
miss sutherland first sang lucia at covent garden in 1959 .	60.988472
( the first metropolitan opera broadcast on dec . 9 will introduce her as lucia .	26.675468
) she has since turned to bellini , whose opera `` beatrice di tenda ' ' in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her to new york last season .	42.20955
she will sing `` la sonambula ' ' with it here next week .	123.63631
it ' s really quite fun -- as long as you like games .	81.48607
you will need a stereo music system , with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new london `` phase 4 ' ' records .	58.855183
there are 12 of these to choose from , all of them of popular music except for the star release , pass in review ( sp-44001 ) .	132.64093
this features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand .	111.43021
complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays london ' s new technique to the best effect .	51.817253
all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program .	30.56242
no reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music .	111.08543
but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music .	30.532663
you definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back .	116.8047
this is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound .	21.260815
london explains that the very distinct directional effect in the phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels .	60.31313
these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record .	66.44198
in some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects .	101.88037
some clue to the character of london ' s approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion ' ' or `` percussive ' ' .	31.860634
drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well .	9.396619
only too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right .	54.862045
they are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley .	50.38089
the percussive twenties ( sp-44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and johnny keating ' s kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in percussive moods ( sp-44005 ) .	19.8549
big band percussion ( sp-44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs -- the arrangements just didn ' t have so much character as the others .	55.75181
there is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies .	64.008026
the penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in melody and percussion for two pianos ( sp-44007 ) .	31.089046
all of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface noise .	32.153606
pass in review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system .	32.007114
many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic .	22.549118
strange , but true -- authenticity and realism often aren ' t related at all .	96.580086
almost every film bearing the imprimatur of hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact , impeccably so .	46.595608
in any given period piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity .	15.424493
the major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter .	38.934666
during the making recently of an important biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with .	44.882526
but , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set ' s edge .	69.15126
the drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all .	60.333664
the storyline , in sort , is wildly unrealistic .	2.336586
thus , in `` the story of ruth ' ' we have ruth , naomi , and boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic .	27.188316
but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i . e . , that ruth remained with naomi and finally wound up with boaz -- the film version has little to do with the bible .	38.03583
and in the new `` king of kings ' ' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the gospels .	19.357777
earlier this month edward r . murrow , director of the united states information agency , came to hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry .	52.801826
he intimated that they weren ' t doing the country much good in the cold war .	42.82544
and to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism .	126.306465
`` in many corners of the globe ' ' , he said , `` the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet .	33.273293
would we want a future-day gibbon or macaulay recounting the saga of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge ? ?	28.78148
yet for much of the globe , hollywood is just that -- prime , if not sole , source of knowledge .	132.9341
if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone , what conclusions do you think he might come to ? ?	162.49864
francois d ' albert , hungarian-born violinist who made his new york debut three years ago , played a return engagement last night in judson hall .	25.294899
he is now president of the chicago conservatory college .	61.404385
his pianist was donald jenni , a faculty member at depaul university .	7.26025
the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so that for the first half of the program , when the piano was partially open , mr . jenni ' s playing was too loud .	38.081264
in vying with him , mr . d ' albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone .	18.339622
this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , mozart ' s sonata in a ( k . 526 ) , which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion .	14.665705
brahm ' s sonata in a , although also vigorous , stood up well under the two artists ' strong , large-scale treatment .	189.69312
mr . d ' albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato .	16.510859
he made the most of the long brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance .	72.60492
a sonata for violin and piano , called `` bella bella ' ' , by robert fleming , was given its first united states performance .	24.949108
the title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer , who is also a member of the national film board of canada .	30.331928
the work ' s two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , are clever enough in a ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom .	19.90652
they might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of hollywood .	38.193146
works by dohnanyi , hubay , mr . d ' albert himself and paganini , indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase .	32.98903
standard items by sarasate and saint-saens completed the program .	19.46914
in recent years anna xydis has played with the new york philharmonic and at lewisohn stadium , but her program last night at town hall was the greek-born pianist ' s first new york recital since 1948 .	27.79711
miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard , and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control .	64.373276
and the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound .	35.129868
since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition , miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure .	42.839916
she played with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures .	130.31642
the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers of this century .	37.72415
it was in them that miss xydis was at her best .	16.334154
the rachmaninoff prelude no . 12 , op . 32 , for instance , gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble .	35.68282
the four kabalevsky preludes were also assured , rich in color and songful .	49.638622
and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that prokofieff needs .	32.53903
miss xydis ' earlier selections were mendelssohn ' s variations serieuses , in which each variation was nicely set off from the others	26.74286
haydn ' s sonata in e minor , which was unfailingly pleasant in sound , and chopin ' s sonata in b flat minor .	26.684086
a memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist ' s performance .	19.680098
so , what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing .	108.30561
miss xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing .	30.042467
all the generals who held important commands in world war 2 , did not write books .	44.526176
and the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written .	198.43025
one of the very best is only now published in this country , five years after its first publication in england .	44.37227
it is `` defeat into victory ' ' , by field marshal viscount slim .	11.753083
a long book heavily weighted with military technicalities , in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally .	88.33225
field marshal slim has abridged it for the benefit of `` those who , finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves , are more interested in men and their reactions to stress , hardship and danger ' ' .	75.77301
the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is , of course , the field marshal himself .	67.28563
william joseph slim , first viscount slim , former governor general of australia , was the principal british commander in the field during the burma war .	50.640156
he had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared , ill-equipped british forces `` were outmaneuvered , outfought and outgeneraled ' ' .	20.622051
he returned in command of an international army of gurkhas , indians , africans , chinese and british .	31.446455
and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war .	22.251917
`` the forgotten war ' ' his soldiers called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines .	76.08561
parts of `` defeat into victory ' ' are a tangle of burmese place names and military units , but a little application makes everything clear enough .	133.18439
on the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book .	5.7775035
field marshal slim is striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes .	48.35599
he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even `` a cardinal error ' ' .	43.71742
he himself seems to be tough , tireless , able and intelligent , more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers .	110.16247
`` defeat into victory ' ' is a dramatic and lively military narrative .	30.318163
but it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action .	83.323326
before he could return to burma , field marshal slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits .	36.992622
his remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command are enlightening .	30.878359
he believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many .	31.133736
he believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there .	99.61931
for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers , when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly .	116.79534
other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all noncombatant troops , whose morale was vital , too	55.7618
administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with top brass -- british , american and chinese	163.72841
health , hygiene , medical aid and preventive medicine	10.431182
hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty )	2.1053166
commenting on these and other matters , field marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks	55.489925
`` when in doubt as to two courses of action , a general should choose the bolder ' ' .	45.072086
`` the commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory -- for that is his duty ' ' .	50.17307
`` it only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them .	311.0762
so i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it ' ' .	28.007086
field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders .	48.738365
of the japanese private he says `` he fought and marched till he died .	23.655722
if 500 japanese were ordered to hold a position , we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves ' ' .	47.050068
brooding about future wars , the field marshal has this to say `` the asian fighting man is at least equally brave ( as the white ) , usually more careless of death , less encumbered by mental doubts , less troubled by humanitarian sentiment , and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him .	50.351578
he is , by background and living standards , better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly , to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort , and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources ' ' .	53.90271
a bunch of young buckaroos from out west , who go by the name of texas boys choir , loped into town hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience .	43.132996
actually , the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded , and they sang it beautifully .	45.05268
under the capable direction of the choir ' s founder , geroge bragg , the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets , excerpts from pergolesi ' s `` stabat mater ' ' and all of the britten `` ceremonial of carols ' ' .	16.68239
their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing .	54.148792
the limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now and then a bleat .	29.383871
but mr . bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor , and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior .	85.425705
most surprising of all , he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words .	45.36594
the latin , for example , was not only clear	69.1648
furthermore , there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music .	15.610923
lines came out neatly and in good balance .	9.69002
the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish .	7.63189
a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly .	13.389126
other capable soloists included david clifton , joseph schockler and pat thompson .	15.01156
the final group included folk songs from back home , stomped out , shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume .	21.223352
boys will be boys , and texans will be texans .	6.9795136
the polish song and dance company called mazowsze , after the region of poland , where it has its headquarters , opened a three-week engagement at the city center last night .	32.53704
a thoroughly ingratiating company it is , and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening .	97.97109
not that it is all funny , by any means , though some of it is definitely so , but simply that the dancers are young and handsome , high-spirited and communicative , and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied .	33.43213
there is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title , for it has a kind of nonstop format , and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification .	56.298656
the material is all basically of folk origin , gleaned from every section of poland .	44.8664
but under the direction of mira ziminska-sygietynska , who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 , it has all been put into theatrical form , treated selectively , choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators , and performed altogether professionally .	110.24418
under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training , and an equally professional sense of performing .	115.291504
since the organization was created thirteen years ago , it is obvious that this is not the original company	16.435839
it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company .	127.69154
the girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters .	43.282375
indeed , there are never fewer than eight of them on stage , and that is only for the more intimate numbers .	53.816658
they can be exuberant or sentimental , flirtatious or funny , but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull .	53.195877
to pick out particular numbers is something of a problem , but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed .	30.906887
there is , for example , a stunning krakowiak that closes the first act	74.812096
the mazurka choreographed by witold zapala to music from moniuszko ' s opera , `` strasny dwor ' , may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see	26.445662
and the dances and songs from the tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men .	65.591835
everywhere there are little touches of humor , and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth .	45.689953
the theatre-by-the-sea , matunuck , presents `` king of hearts ' ' by jean kerr and eleanor brooke .	6.663434
producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season ' s opener at matunuck in jean kerr ' s `` king of hearts ' ' .	15.557347
the dialogue is sharp , witty and candid -- typical `` don ' t eat the daisies ' ' material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience liked it .	50.094326
the story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the american boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material .	53.319042
this is when his troubles begin , not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect to the hero ' s sweetheart-secretary .	34.660812
john heffernan , playing larry larkin , the cartoonist , carries the show in marvelous fashion .	59.037857
his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless .	11.547948
this may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of david hedison , providence ' s contribution to hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th century-fox .	33.561428
not that mr . hedison does not make the most of his role .	20.784636
but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way .	17.713388
a word should be said for gary morgan , a broadway youngster who , as the adopted son , makes life miserable for nearly everybody and larkin in particular .	102.80706
and for his playmate , francis coletta of west warwick , who has a bit part , billy .	49.830357
on the whole , audiences will like this performance .	43.50379
it is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the matunuck cast does well by it .	106.36558
the newport playhouse presents `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' by john osborne and anthony creighton , directed by wallace gray .	8.749581
the angriest young man in newport last night was at the playhouse , where `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' opened as the jazz festival closed .	47.978443
for the hero of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session .	24.21876
he ' s mad at a world he did not make .	18.97094
furthermore , he ' s something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips .	29.885614
this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards .	50.272827
they not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well .	65.53631
it is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that george dillon enters at the beginning of the play .	67.75208
an unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists .	223.5338
by the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells .	42.817047
not altogether a successful play , `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling .	60.718353
it is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk is terribly impressive .	45.974743
but it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .	74.641914
there is a fine second act , as an example , one in which samuel groom , as dillon , has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another .	43.314613
this is an exciting young actor to watch .	4.1158586
just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch .	97.79023
miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment .	32.8794
also fine are sue lawless , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , harold cherry , as her scratchy spouse , and hildy weissman , as a vegetable in human form .	43.053345
wallace gray has directed a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste .	70.49732
still , his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair .	50.790913
the warwick musical theater presents `` where ' s charley ? ?	1.841717
' ' with music and lyrics by frank loesser , directed by christopher hewett , choreography by peter conlow , musical direction by samuel matlowsky .	14.506534
everybody fell in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater , and shelley berman was to blame .	16.575274
one of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented , `` once in love with amy ' ' is also , of course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of american musical comedy in our era .	28.058187
so the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after act 2 , got a rousing opening chorus , `` where ' s charley ? ?	56.574677
' ' , and berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being .	33.59016
it is greatly to berman ' s credit that he made no attempt to outdo ray bolger .	18.661257
he dropped his earlier and delightful hamming , which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called `` charley ' s aunt ' ' , and let himself go with as appealing an `` amy ' ' as anybody could ask .	71.56612
in brief , berman played himself and not bolger .	16.762243
the big audience started applauding even before he had finished .	63.227722
the whole production this week is fresh and lively .	20.500078
the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days .	39.161755
the ballet work is on the nose , especially in the opening number by `` the new ashmolean marching society and students ' conservatory band ' ' , along with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later .	40.108017
berman , whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist , proved himself very much at home in musical comedy .	83.48038
sparrow-size virginia gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky amy , while melisande congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best gibson girl manner .	29.021992
all told , `` where ' s charley ? ?	3.166013
it has a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , mr . berman .	24.036827
the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c . edwin knill ' s and martin tahse ' s production of `` fiorello ! !	15.019411
the book is by jerome weidman and george abbott , music by jerry bock , lyrics by sheldon harnick , choreography by peter gennaro , scenery , costumes and lighting by william and jean eckart , musical direction by jack elliott , and the production was directed by mr . abbott .	15.5677595
this is one of the happier events of the season .	28.599024
the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the little flower rides to break a lance again .	41.89956
' ' performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company is every bit as good , and perhaps better .	92.99875
certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking .	21.803932
bob carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to laguardia as tom bosley does , but i was amazed at the way he became more and more fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch one ' s self up and remember that this wasn ' t really laguardia come back among us again .	57.304134
then rudy bond was simply grand as ben , the distraught republican party district chieftain .	19.5506
and paul lipson , as morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his shirley ' s dinner , was fine , too .	66.340805
as for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man .	56.831112
charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie , who became the second mrs . laguardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction .	50.418514
jen nelson , as thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive .	206.348
and little zeme north , a dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings .	45.775494
such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` on the side of the angels ' ' and `` politics and poker ' ' were handled splendidly , and i thought rudy bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` little tin box ' ' even better than it was done by the new york cast	42.923122
all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity .	110.10727
the party at floyd ' s penthouse gave the `` chorines ' ' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era ' s nonsense .	20.009035
laguardia ' s multi-lingual rallies , when he is running for congress , are well staged , and wind up in a wild jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater .	96.690445
martin tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions .	26.669546
not a corner has been visibly cut in this one .	44.66219
the sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that doesn ' t pause long in any one place , and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness .	30.489605
( several times recently i have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes .	41.08707
i ' m glad to say there ' s none of that distraction in this `` fiorello ! !	24.745642
it has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater .	65.82463
loew ' s theater presents `` where the boys are ' ' , an mgm picture produced by joe pasternak and directed by henry levin from a screenplay by george wells .	23.773952
since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich brown senior , while two yalies are cast as virtual rapists , i suppose i should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` where the boys are ' ' , but i shall do nothing of the sort .	48.75202
instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- i hasten to report that it ' s a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort lauderdale , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say , sex .	27.45956
the answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual .	142.16072
if most of them weren ' t exactly specific -- well , that ' s the way it is in life , i guess .	74.58047
but at least it ' s reassuring to see some teenagers who don ' t profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead .	40.81078
`` where the boys are ' ' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy .	52.463833
there are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations -- the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid ' ' is performing .	25.669106
most of the female faces are new , or at least not too familiar .	123.26885
dolores hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable .	10.135362
i was delighted with paula prentiss ' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one ' s highest hopes might ask .	93.29314
a couple of the males made good comedy , too -- jim hutton and frank gorshin .	15.317501
the only performance which was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , i suppose this was the attitude the part called for .	55.882862
i must say , however , that i preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it .	111.99641
to anyone who remembers newport at its less than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz festival ought to prove entertaining .	52.5411
the second feature , `` the price of silence ' ' , is a british detective story that will talk your head off .	50.106415
the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james was never more evident than in his letters .	38.77168
here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking .	69.342766
to both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment .	54.149994
for this latest addition to the great letters series , under the general editorship of louis kronenberger , miss hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of james ' s genius , not to mention the felicities of his style .	30.546513
his famous criticism of brother henry ' s `` third style ' ' is surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter ' s intricate air castles as henry himself could ever have produced .	51.314335
his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant , forthright , and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child , and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor .	66.63876
most of all , his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain whitehead ' s reference to james as `` that adorable genius ' ' .	39.47865
miss hardwick speaks of his `` superb gift for intellectual friendship ' ' , and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism .	33.160065
this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought .	71.09629
it holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word `` intellectual ' ' has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues .	41.913353
to his harvard colleague , josiah royce , whose philosophic position differed radically from his own , james could write , `` different as our minds are , yours has nourished mine , as no other social influence ever has , and in converse with you i have always felt that my life was being lived importantly ' ' .	64.72944
of another colleague , george santayana , he could write `` the great event in my life recently has been the reading of santayana ' s book .	45.097717
although i absolutely reject the platonism of it , i have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page ' ' .	28.908379
writing to his colleague george herbert palmer -- `` glorious old palmer ' ' , as he addresses him -- james says that if only the students at harvard could really understand royce , santayana , palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems are `` so many religions , ways of fronting life , and worth fighting for ' ' , then harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe .	85.18359
`` the best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems .	84.287796
the world might ring with the struggle , if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other ' ' .	68.4015
the `` belaboring ' ' is of course jocular , yet james was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of god .	46.789062
to james this vision never quite came , despite his appreciation of it in others .	61.410355
but there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent `` you ask what i am going to ' reply ' to bradley .	49.70552
but why need one reply to everything and everybody ? ?	32.05084
i think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations .	4.3672867
all polemic of ours should , i believe , be either very broad statements of contrast , or fine points treated singly , and as far as possible impersonally .	100.87384
as far as the rising generation goes , why not simply express ourselves positively , and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other .	51.83104
here again ' god will know his own ' ' ' .	25.838488
the collected works of james thurber , now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy knows .	45.831295
the primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings , akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall , is equally well known .	24.848679
about all that remains to be said is that the present selection , most of which appeared first in the new yorker , comprises ( as usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace , held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book .	30.83125
the one unifying note , if any , is sounded in the initial article entitled `` how to get through the day ' ' .	51.024494
it is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs , the hospitalized , and others forced to rely on inner resources , including ( in the p ' s alone ) `` palindromes ' ' , `` paraphrases ' ' , and `` parodies ' ' .	19.181995
`` the tyranny of trivia ' ' suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber .	14.612853
and new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled `` friends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ear-muffs ' ' , `` such a phrase as drifts through dream ' ' , and `` the new vocabularianism ' ' .	19.709011
some of thurber ' s curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor , malapropism , and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases .	31.956114
a burlesque paean entitled `` hark the herald tribune , times , and all the other angels sing ' ' brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey .	32.498566
`` how the kooks crumble ' ' features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-tv commercials , and `` the watchers of the night ' ' is a veritable waking nightmare .	10.723465
a semi-serious literary document entitled `` the wings of henry james ' ' is noteworthy , if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master ' s difficult later period by modest owen wister , author of `` the virginian ' ' .	28.345522
james , he remarks in a letter to a friend , `` is attempting the impossible namely , to produce upon the reader , as a painting produces upon the gazer , a number of superimposed , simultaneous impressions .	28.507645
he would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once , and get all at once , the various shadings and complexities ' ' .	49.731873
equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation `` so much has already been written about everything that you can ' t find out anything about it ' ' .	31.75563
or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) `` woman ' s place is in the wrong ' ' .	16.096874
who but thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences ? ?	8.827817
a tribute to midsummer `` bang-sashes ' ' seems terribly funny , though it would be hard to explain why .	24.090872
`` one of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped out of sleep and out of bed .	53.00064
' it ' s just a bat ' , said my wife reassuringly , and i sighed with relief .	40.172752
' thank god for that ' , i said	119.33091
' i thought it was a human being ' ' ' .	26.763308
in a sense , perhaps , thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( was it salvador dali ? ?	10.500727
) who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen .	21.209482
that is , it is literally a picture window you don ' t see into the viscera	22.000483
you see a picture -- trees , or flowers .	60.898212
this is something like what thurber ' s best effects are like , if i am not mistaken .	66.818825
though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume ) thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple , unaffected humanness .	28.915106
in his concluding paragraph he writes `` the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can ' ' .	86.91797
for many readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight .	10.390145
the master ' s hand has lost none of its craft .	65.44799
he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties .	23.816473
the reader meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse , and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself , and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race , her hair standing straight out .	54.63401
but there is a difference between the present volume and the early low .	86.134926
there is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show .	82.860664
but there was terror in the thirties when the nazis were on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning .	92.96971
anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference .	196.79314
it might be argued that the communists are less inhuman than the nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key .	78.4692
but this argument cannot be pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion .	64.70367
the communists wield a power unknown to hitler .	9.612271
and the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remains the same .	74.60637
do we ourselves offer mr . low less of a crusade ? ?	23.848469
in the thirties we would not face our enemy	819.5493
that was a nightmarish situation and low was in his element .	42.774242
we are stronger and more self-confident -- and low cannot so easily put us to rights .	186.084
or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere ? ?	33.923985
it might be that low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now .	34.989174
he writes , `` confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime ' ' .	216.84758
whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic .	20.170555
he does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man .	10.790287
the skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath .	26.593822
low seems to have supported eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently , so there is no fire in his eye .	88.28025
stalin ' s death , churchill ' s farewell to public life , hillary and tensing on everest , quemoy and matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade .	16.789406
instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles .	4.3341002
did low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections ? ?	51.330452
he showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines .	23.07712
and khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all .	29.606722
look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale .	97.941574
read the moderately brief text , not for captions , sometimes for tart epigrams , once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas .	45.737743
a gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man , city slicker , lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over catfish bend in this third relaxed allegory from mr . burman ' s refreshing louisiana animal community .	59.464504
the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from new orleans , accompanied by one wharf rat .	16.128965
but like all despots , as he builds his following from among the gullible , he grows more threatening toward those who won ' t follow -- such solid citizens as doc raccoon	81.40393
and the eagle , who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in washington posing for fifty-cent pieces .	70.286896
as soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats , who , of course , say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city .	24.208456
( the followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others .	54.723858
) they train the mink and other animals to fight .	31.899473
and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won ' t have anyone around that ' s against him , and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds .	62.287373
robert hillyer , the poet , writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that mr . burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish bend series .	25.764927
he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes .	53.395576
but it ' s hard to imagine mr . burman as a nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables .	22.793499
in substance they lie somewhere between the southern dialect animal stories of joel chandler harris ( uncle remus ) and the polished , witty fables of james thurber .	17.184483
george kennan ' s account of relations between russia and the west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war 2 , is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years .	20.927649
it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era ' s great historical issues .	43.130947
in short , the book , based largely on lectures delivered at harvard university , is both reliable and readable	60.68828
the author possesses an uncommonly fine english style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time .	38.776737
if mr . kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well , the record itself is not too encouraging .	50.8955
mr . kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken .	17.346226
but he rejects , perhaps a little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the yalta conference in february , 1945 .	36.63891
after all , alger hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret state department documents to soviet agents , was at yalta .	38.23275
and harry dexter white , implicated in f . b . i . reports in communist associations , was one of the architects of the morgenthau plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply handed germany to stalin .	77.22292
one item in this unhappy scheme was to have germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength .	46.77638
it is quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender ' ' had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with communism .	39.729504
mr . kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way	461.5213
`` you see , first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills , the unshakeable american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo , but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil , with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy ' s power , no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future ' ' .	44.642887
recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with hitler , he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-nazi underground , which very nearly eliminated hitler in 1944 .	64.96948
a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of russian language , history and literature , kennan recalls how , at the time of hitler ' s attack on the soviet union in 1941 , he penned a private note to a state department official , expressing the hope that `` never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries ' ' .	41.13237
with justified bitterness the author speaks of `` what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the russian communist movement , about the history of its diplomacy , about what had happened in the purges , and about what had been going on in poland and the baltic states ' ' .	32.2186
he also speaks of franklin d . roosevelt ' s `` puerile ' ' assumption that `` if only he ( stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like f . d . r . himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and russia ' s co-operation with the west could be easily arranged ' ' .	36.504265
no wonder khrushchev ' s first message to president kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the `` good old days ' ' of roosevelt .	40.213535
this fascinating story begins with a sketch , rich in personal detail , of the glancing mutual impact of world war 1 , and the two instalments of the russian revolution .	25.451756
the first of these involved the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government in march , 1917	24.461544
the second , the seizure of power by the bolsheviks ( who later called themselves communists ) in november of the same year .	42.396954
as kennan shows , the judgment of the allied governments about what was happening in russia was warped by the obsession of defeating germany .	23.948832
they were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fighting .	140.15721
they attributed everything that went wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue .	63.37266
this , more than any other factor , led to the fiasco of allied intervention .	23.335894
`` had a world war not been in progress , there would never , under any conceivable stretch of the imagination , have been an allied intervention in north russia ' ' .	55.918583
the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by communist propaganda	10.592167
here kennan , operating with precise facts and figures , performs an excellent job of debunking .	28.598328
of many passages in the book that exemplify the author ' s vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected .	28.562616
`` this was a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits	99.5123
a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity	77.499405
a man in whose entourage none was ever safe	9803.704
a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment	39.49214
a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime .	47.38888
and here is kennan ' s image of hitler , stalin ' s temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples , and his later enemy	20.237213
`` behind that charlie chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lay a statesman of no mean qualities shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed -- like stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possessing one gift stalin did not possess the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word ' ' .	47.28857
two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan .	27.884844
and in a concluding chapter about america ' s stance in the contemporary world , one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war .	33.592224
mr . kennan , who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia , is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future .	34.524174
the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relations is vitally important , and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator .	32.40949
the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest , lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm .	52.494324
in `` donnybrook ' ' , there is quite a different eire , a rural land where singing , dancing , fist-fighting and romancing are the thing .	49.136646
there is plenty of violence , to be sure , but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed .	29.838
by and large , robert mcenroe ' s adaptation of maurice walsh ' s film , `` the quiet man ' ' , provides the entertainment it set out to , and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one .	37.413807
this is the tale of one john enright , an american who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man .	45.16947
but innesfree , where ellen roe danaher and her bullying brother , will , live , is no place for a man who will not use his fists .	63.50034
so enright ' s courting of the mettlesome ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told .	79.179276
you may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook means .	71.858215
then there is a matchmaker , one mikeen flynn , a role for which eddie foy was happily selected .	21.39914
now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs , torso and neck , except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play .	37.40387
mr . foy is a joy , having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect .	89.32811
his matchmaking is , naturally , incidental , and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony .	90.67592
art lund , a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice , impersonates enright .	12.97846
although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique , that ' s not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have , anyway .	48.937183
joan fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not , plays ellen , and sings the role very well , too .	77.76753
if the mettle which ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind	23.635279
she fits into the general scheme well enough .	15.932675
susan johnson , as the widow , spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one .	48.843792
she has a good , firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening .	31.674685
then there are a pair of old biddies played by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock irish characters , but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they ' re quite entertaining .	55.986027
and in the role of will danaher , philip bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british army , if he chose .	77.762566
`` donnybrook ' ' is no `` brigadoon ' ' , but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing .	56.518436
the ballads are sweet and sad , and the music generally competent .	103.253975
it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain , and some of it , such as the catchy `` sez i ' ' , does .	32.288834
`` a toast to the bride ' ' , sung by clarence nordstrom , playing a character called old man toomey , is quite simple , direct and touching .	34.979366
the men of innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters , and their dancing and singing is fine .	24.821962
so is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under jack cole ' s expert choreographic direction .	13.198531
the male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating .	39.050625
rouben ter-arutunian , in his stage settings , often uses the scrim curtain behind which mr . cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow .	44.496002
there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at `` donnybrook ' ' , unless they are permanently in the mood of enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable irish .	33.02593
we can all breathe more easily this morning -- more easily and joyously , too -- because joshua logan has turned the stage show , `` fanny ' ' , into a delightful and heart-warming film .	31.773722
the task of taking the raw material of marcel pagnol ' s original trio of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and putting them again on the screen , after their passage through the broadway musical idiom , was a delicate and perilous one , indeed .	43.489212
more than the fans of pagnol ' s old films and of their heroic star , the great raimu , were looking askance at the project .	51.95786
the fans of the musical were , too .	23.57302
but now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the english-dialogue picture at the music hall yesterday .	44.640984
whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show , whether partial to music or not , you can ' t help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart .	80.69695
some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow .	120.61953
a tiny handful never did make the concert .	4.994309
but , after a fifteen-minute delay , the substantially complete philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon ' s proceedings .	41.89374
they faced a rather small audience , as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon .	32.90731
paul paray , rounding out his current stint with the orchestra , is a solid musician , and the philharmonic plays for him .	51.36642
their collaboration in the beethoven second symphony was lucid , intelligent and natural sounding .	12.413685
it was not a heavy , ponderous beethoven .	4.369644
the music sang nicely , sprinted evenly when necessary , was properly accented and balanced .	56.72906
the franck symphonic poem , `` psyche ' ' , is a lush , sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again .	26.823553
fortunate for the music itself , it is not too frequent a visitor	65.95499
if it were , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying .	23.649878
mr . paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score .	8.213394
he did not let the strings , for instance , weep , whine or get hysterical .	12.778662
his interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy .	18.853241
and in the prokofieff c major piano concerto , with zadel skolovsky as soloist , he was an admirable partner .	13.9858465
mr . skolovsky ' s approach to the concerto was bold , sweeping and tonally percussive .	11.045599
he swept through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner .	11.131437
an impressive technician , mr . skolovsky has fine rhythm , to boot .	73.94216
his tone is the weakest part of his equipment	3115.015
a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs .	422.78973
it is , after all , a non-romantic work ( even with the big , juicy melody of the second movement )	142.94719
and the composer himself was called the `` age of steel pianist ' ' .	27.298073
but granted all this , one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than mr . skolovsky supplied .	34.35399
taken as a whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra .	128.52034
mr . skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received .	59.449165
a new work on the program was nikolai lopatnikoff ' s `` festival overture ' ' , receiving its first new york hearing .	14.957182
this was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry .	35.33703
it runs a little more than ten minutes , is workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless .	9.528163
`` la gioconda ' ' , like it or not , is a singer ' s opera .	53.47613
and so , of course , it is a fan ' s opera as well .	42.78565
snow or no , the fans were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance of the ponchielli work .	36.65361
so the plot creaks , the sets are decaying , the costumes are pre-historic , the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing .	33.060482
after all , the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed , with no less than six leading parts .	46.73877
one of those parts is that of evil , evil barnaba , the spy .	12.338935
his wicked deeds were carried on by anselmo colzani , who was taking the part for the first time with the company .	25.661554
he has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone .	46.700806
what was lacking was a real sense of phrase , the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is , after all , a very oily character .	40.43616
regina resnik as laura and cesare siepi as alvise also were new to the cast , but only with respect to this season	67.69989
they have both sung these parts here before .	40.860455
laura is a good role for miss resnik , and she gave it force , dramatic color and passion .	61.525543
mr . siepi was , as always , a consummate actor	10.717364
with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently .	5.5196877
part of this characterization was , of course , accomplished with the vocal chords .	20.448193
unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality .	166.77057
eileen farrell in the title role , mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season , and all contributed to a vigorous performance .	31.356833
if only they and fausto cleva in the pit had got together a bit more .	79.13685
`` melodious birds sing madrigals ' ' saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could be imagined .	15.544423
stereo bgs 5031 ) is a good sample of the special , elegant art of english madrigal singing .	27.038712
it also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of italian and english madrigals plus several french `` chansons ' ' .	53.301125
the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else .	19.01679
the original impulses came to england late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo , sonatas , operas and the like .	37.741333
even after elizabethan traditions were weakened by the cromwellian interregnum , the practice of singing together -- choruses , catches and glees -- always flourished .	11.301631
the english never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in italy blotted out the italian madrigal .	59.933205
latter-day interest in elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in england , much ahead of similar revivals in other countries .	41.43342
as a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the english madrigal .	90.730415
naturally , mr . deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen william byrd , thomas morley and thomas tomkins .	38.75713
there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture .	69.95261
both techniques give the music purity and clarity .	3.3188806
claude jannequin ' s vocal description of a battle ( the french equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by jannequin and lassus .	26.074713
only with the more sensual , intense and baroque expressions of marenzio , monteverdi and gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial .	10.969445
nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduced , make it an attractive look-see at the period .	36.441772
the elements of elegance and color in jannequin are strong french characteristics .	200.97618
baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tends to be strong , lively , intense , controlled and quite abstract .	36.591557
in france , it remained always more picturesque , more dancelike , more full of flavor .	24.88235
couperin and rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote , not in the later sense of `` program music ' ' but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance .	71.48205
both composers turn up on new imports from france .	6.089088
bam is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is editions de la boite a musique .	78.45936
they specialize in out-of-the-way items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention .	57.57523
sonates et concerts royaux of couperin le grand occupy two disks ( ld056 and ld060 ) and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master -- delicate , flexible and gemlike .	23.855394
the concerts -- nos . 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian sense .	65.87321
the sonatas , `` la francaise ' ' , `` la sultane ' ' , `` l ' astree ' ' and `` l ' imperiale ' ' , are often more elaborately worked out and , in fact , show a strong italian influence .	17.95903
couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called musique francaise du 18e siecle ( bam ld 060 ) .	6.892844
jean-marie leclair still is remembered a bit , but bodin de beismortier , corrette and mondonville are hardly household words .	26.304089
what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo .	76.142265
the couperin `` la steinkerque ' ' , with its battle music , brevity , wit and refined simplicity , already shakes off corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era .	30.993042
if couperin shows the fashionable trend , the others do so all the more .	273.40265
all these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic .	47.79504
rameau ' s six concerts en sextuor , recorded by l ' orchestre de chambre pierre menet ( bam ld 046 ) , turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself .	22.135149
the strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious .	21.726467
maitres allemands des 17e et 18e siecles contains music by pachelbel , buxtehude , rosenmueller and telemann , well performed by the ensemble instrumental sylvie spycket ( bam ld 035 ) .	8.723101
rococo music -- a lot of it -- was played in carnegie recital hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts .	83.876625
works by j . c . bach , anton craft , joseph haydn , giuseppe sammartini , comenico dragonetti and j . g . janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff , flutist , josef marx , oboist , and robert conant , pianist and harpsichordist .	13.419716
since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven to boulez .	27.186584
thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on saturday night .	57.926613
each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but taken together they grew quite tiresome .	105.207924
the performances were variable , those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying , some by soloists proving rather trying .	123.870155
ellie mao , soprano , and frederick fuller , baritone , presented a program of folksongs entitled `` east meets west ' ' in carnegie recital hall last night .	28.104397
they were accompanied by anna mi lee , pianist .	55.277416
selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages .	13.151987
songs from china and japan were reserved exclusively for miss mao , who is a native of china , and those of the british isles were sung by mr . fuller , who is english by birth .	26.763544
this was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles .	227.98042
on the contrary , miss mao and mr . fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as mendelssohn , dvorak , canteloube , copland and britten .	23.353804
there was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise .	45.614647
the performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal .	37.175385
what was omitted from `` a neglected education ' ' were those essentials known as `` the facts of life ' ' .	15.764251
chabrier ' s little one-act operetta , presented yesterday afternoon at town hall , is a fragile , precious little piece , very french , not without wit and charm .	60.080826
the poor uneducated newlywed , a certain gontran de boismassif , has his problems in getting the necessary information .	125.72007
the humor of the situation can be imagined .	12.5315
it all takes place in the eighteenth century .	1.8630421
what a silly , artificial way of life , chabrier and his librettists chuckle .	8.859864
but they wish they could bring it back .	5.4230404
chabrier ' s delightful music stands just at the point where the classical , rationalist tradition , ( handed down to chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) becomes virtually neo-classicism .	35.968548
the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish .	45.35276
the simple , clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes .	19.332968
the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano .	74.63027
benita valente was delightful as the young wife and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring .	20.744574
the work was presented as the final event in the town hall festival of music .	27.658602
it was paired with a darius milhaud opera , `` the poor sailor ' ' , set to a libretto by jean cocteau , a kind of grand guignol by the sea , a sailor returns , unrecognized , and gets done in by his wife .	25.847582
with the exception of a few spots , milhaud ' s music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties , odd harmonies , and lumbering , satiric orchestration .	19.259546
had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon .	21.102636
sat there and as a woman sang , she kept getting thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5 , 500 other people .	41.606094
i make this observation about the lady , miss judy garland , because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote in the paper the next day	58.68236
but who cares , when the lady sings ? ?	31.364315
certainly not the largest afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet .	49.794743
they applauded every number , not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord .	65.18171
and judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed , at times , a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings .	29.605593
things like `` when you ' re smiling ' ' , `` almost like being in love ' ' , `` do it again ' ' , `` born to wander ' ' , `` alone together ' ' , `` who cares ? ?	24.295946
' ' , `` puttin ' on the ritz ' ' , `` how long has this been going on ? ?	26.04725
' ' and her own personal songs like `` the man that got away ' ' , and the inevitable `` over the rainbow ' ' .	26.25689
miss garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen .	21.377258
at the start of her program there were evidences of pique .	13.579008
she had held to the letter of her contract and didn ' t come onto the stage until well after 4 p . m . , the appointed hour , although the music at newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3 .	77.67055
then there was a bad delay in getting mort lindsey ' s 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs .	8.076368
along about 4 30 , just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side , judy came on singing , in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind .	34.35765
her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing .	49.41363
in her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm . lenses and shoot at extreme range .	38.21486
there also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` do it again ' ' , and she made the tart observation that `` i never saw so much moving about in an audience ' ' .	54.830612
but it didn ' t take judy garland , showman , long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at newport and that you have to learn to live with it .	45.554012
before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music , trundling microphones about the stage , helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere .	57.166798
and time after time she really belted out her songs .	39.01285
sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged -- which was the way i felt about her `` come rain or come shine ' ' -- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent , like her shatteringly beautiful `` beautiful weather ' ' .	48.20654
to her partisan audience , such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise	58.78005
they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more , as though they could never get enough .	72.77008
they were rewarded with splendid , exciting , singing .	38.869705
her `` rockabye your baby ' ' was as good as it can be done , and her really personal songs , like `` the man that got away ' ' were deeply moving .	108.14177
the audience wouldn ' t let her leave until it had heard `` over the rainbow ' ' -- although the fellow that kept crying for `` get happy ' ' had to go home unhappy , about that item anyway .	81.09373
she was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers .	43.3742
all went home happy except the newport police , who feared that the throng departing at 6 35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh , and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar .	34.89721
in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies .	16.57212
this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening -- flashes in the distance , but no storm .	35.584522
several times it came near breaking , and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from jerry mulligan ' s big band , which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond found count basie working in a kansas city trap .	80.13084
mulligan ' s band has been infected with his solid sense of swing , and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations .	43.521763
but what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan ' s baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyer ' s arrangement of `` django ' s castle ' ' .	15.133596
for subtle swinging rhythms , i could admire intensely mulligan ' s version of `` weep ' ' , and the fireworks went on display in `` 18 carrots for robert ' ' , a sax tribute to johnny hodges .	18.864077
there was considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the jazz messengers , who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group .	27.971725
unfortunately , blakey doesn ' t choose to work much of the time in this vein .	28.058609
he prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like .	161.30058
what we did get , however , was impressive .	228.80135
a few drops of rain just before midnight , when sarah vaughan was in the midst of her first number , scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly , but at this hour and with sarah on the stand , most of the listeners didn ' t care whether they got wet .	46.657738
miss vaughan was back in top form , somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time -- like a fine wine .	55.60223
after the spate of female vocalists we have been having , all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat , it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever .	64.079575
the evening program was opened by the jazz three , a newport group consisting of steve budieshein on bass , jack warner , drums , and don cook , piano .	17.753677
this was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night when the eddie stack group , also local talent , went on first .	167.87024
putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot , when the audience is cold , restless , and in flux	101.97855
it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear , and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous newport audience .	50.41078
the jazz three displayed their sound musicianship , not only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for al minns & leon james , the superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three successive years , gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program .	42.752148
julie wilson , a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists , sang a set , a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as `` hard-hearted hannah , the vamp of savannah ' ' , and the delightful `` sunday ' ' .	27.014387
she frosted the cake with the always reliable `` bill bailey ' ' .	16.792946
from this taste of the 1920s , we leaped way out to stan getz ' s private brand of progressive jazz , which did lovely , subtle things for `` baubles , bangles and beads ' ' , and a couple of ballards .	24.414852
he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over .	32.13791
in this he is sticking with tradition , however far removed from it he may seem to be .	111.04645
george shearing took over with his well disciplined group , a sextet consisting of vibes , guitar , bass , drums , shearing ' s piano and a bongo drummer .	9.773931
he met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to latin american things like the mambo .	36.205334
shearing , himself , seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport appearances .	146.63242
a very casual , pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make newport ' s afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach .	45.326363
divided almost equally into two parts , it consisted of `` the evolution of the blues ' ' , narrated by jon hendricks , who had presented it last year at the monterey , calif . , jazz festival , and an hour-long session of maynard ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big band .	11.494768
hendricks ' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him .	73.10929
tracing the blues from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the west indies , he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches .	44.296494
to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had `` big ' ' miller , as a preacher-singer and hannah dean , gospel-singer , while oscar brown jr . , an extremely talented young man , did a slave auctioneer ' s call , a field-hands ' work song , and a beautifully sung negro lullaby , `` brown baby ' ' , which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival .	35.65316
one of those delightful surprise additions , which so frequently occur in jazz programs , was an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe jones , drumming to `` old man river ' ' , which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year ' s concerts .	51.742107
demonstrating the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the blues was michael babatunde olatunji , who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest .	41.18048
he has been on previous newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year ' s afternoon concerts .	56.072563
jimmy witherspoon , blues singer ( and a good one ) , and the ike isaacs trio , which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now , helping him with the musical examples .	68.71153
pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in schubert ' s sonatas .	42.302063
music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example , played for rca by emil gilels .	100.118
he has chosen sonata op . 53 in aj .	7.005265
the playing takes both sides of the disc .	6.695607
perhaps one of the reasons these sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length .	135.38855
rhythmic interest , melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one ' s attention with the gilels playing .	63.344627
his technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully .	6.215985
the male chorus of the robert shaw chorale sings sea shanties in fine style .	34.053623
what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question .	59.20862
do you say chantey , as if the word were derived from the french word chanter , to sing , or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin , which derives its name from the french-canadian use of the word chantier , with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard ? ?	43.444885
either way , the robert shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening .	58.778
if your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one .	38.418945
the london label offers an operatic recital by ettore bastianini , a baritone whose fame is international .	13.45162
murray louis and his dance company appeared at the henry street playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` signal ' ' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` journal ' ' .	28.609793
`` signal ' ' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin nikolais .	38.34795
here , as in `` journal ' ' , mr . louis has given himself the lion ' s share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements .	30.492477
indeed , both `` journal ' ' and `` signal ' ' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics .	12.752557
but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing .	37.87235
one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development .	72.399666
it may be , of course , that mr . louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation .	83.05145
but it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time .	30.29174
one thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be .	47.888836
a brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary american mores entitled `` an american journey ' ' was given its first new york performance at hunter college playhouse last night by the helen tamiris-daniel nagrin dance company .	28.835096
choreographed by mr . nagrin , the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first new york showing of miss tamiris ' `` once upon a time ' ' as well as her `` women ' s song ' ' and mr . nagrin ' s `` indeterminate figure ' ' .	28.308458
eugene lester assembled a witty and explicit score for `` an american journey ' ' , and malcolm mccormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes .	17.207146
mr . nagrin has described four `` places ' ' , each with its scenery and people , added two `` diversions ' ' , and concluded with `` a toccata for the young ' ' , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock ' n ' roll dancing .	34.4601
the `` places ' ' could be anywhere , the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody ' s , and the laugh is on us all .	46.788258
but we need not mind too much , because mr . nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way .	65.79441
miss tamiris ' `` once upon a time ' ' is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three `` figures ' ' that bother them somehow .	48.651978
unfortunately , the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so .	54.052296
nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time .	37.0637
the music here , russell smith ' s `` tetrameron ' ' , sounded good .	12.984242
all the performances of the evening were smooth and assured , and the sizable company , with mr . nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers , seemed to be fine shape .	63.14303
the symphony of the air , greatly assisted by van cliburn , last night got its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall off to a good start .	40.26437
at the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at carnegie , and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs , repeating each of them in five different communities .	60.739285
this news , announced by jerome toobin , the orchestra ' s administrative director , brought applause from the 2 , 800 persons who filled the hall .	42.951653
they showed they were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln center of the new york philharmonic , the philadelphia orchestra and the boston symphony .	46.222084
this season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county center in white plains .	46.212994
the details of the suburban concerts next season , and the centers in which they will be given , will be announced later , mr . toobin said .	37.078053
the concertos that van cliburn has been associated with in new york since his triumphant return from russia in 1958 have been the tchaikovsky , the rachmaninoff third , and the prokofieff third .	49.54506
it was pleasant last night , therefore , to hear him do something else a concerto he has recently recorded , `` the emperor ' ' .	59.74369
the young texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him .	68.769226
but they were not what distinguished his performance .	5.2136536
the elements that did were the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final rondo .	31.709026
mr . cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne .	10.458539
alfred wallenstein , the conductor , sensitive accompanist that he is , picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding , poetic mystery .	84.115906
the collaboration was remarkable , as it was in both the other movements , too .	167.48055
mr . wallenstein , who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle , also conducted the `` leonore ' ' overture no . 3 and the fourth symphony .	27.446514
the orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively .	60.089676
and although there was plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical , yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven .	58.078396
igor oistrakh will be the next soloist on feb . 4 .	6.51508
there are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in .	131.12012
today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it is understandable that a song , no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it .	65.12762
in the more casually constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit .	41.567593
yet there is the classic case of the gershwins ' `` the man i love ' ' .	19.796764
deemed too static when it was first heard in `` lady be good ' ' in philadelphia in 1924 , it was dropped from the score .	62.154423
it was heard again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of `` strike up the band ' ' and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up .	37.39498
it finally reached broadway in the second and successful version of `` strike up the band ' ' in 1929 .	25.730637
( still another song in `` strike up the band ' ' -- `` i ' ve got a crush on you ' ' -- was retrieved from a 1928 failure , `` treasure girl ' ' .	14.215629
like the gershwins , richard rodgers and lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them .	56.42556
if one of mr . rodgers ' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure , mr . hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show .	74.37155
several of these double entries have been collected by ben bagley and michael mcwhinney , along with rodgers and hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to new york and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard rodgers and hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , rodgers and hart revisited ( spruce records , 505 fifth avenue , new york ) .	21.755075
among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of `` the garrick gaieties ' ' , an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from rodgers and hart in the years that followed	24.590464
dorothy loudon ' s raucous listing of the attractions `` at the roxy music hall ' ' from `` i married an angel ' '	25.000877
and the incisive style with which charlotte rae delivers the top-drawer hart lyrics of `` i blush ' ' , a song that was cut from `` a connecticut yankee ' ' .	17.206799
altogether fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists .	15.280366
norman paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment	4.813968
turning to the current musical season on broadway , the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals , how to succeed in business without really trying , has been transferred to an original cast album ( r . c . a . victor loc 1066	44.012623
stereo lso 1066 ) that has some entertaining moments , although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect .	38.739735
robert morse , singing with comically plaintive earnestness , carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in frank loesser ' s score .	65.34266
rudy vallee , who shares star billing with mr . morse , makes only two appearances .	39.752754
he shares with mr . morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by virginia martin , a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice .	38.438526
in general , mr . loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer .	88.12438
like mr . loesser , jerry herman is both composer and lyriist for milk and honey ( r . c . a . victor loc 1065	25.389795
stereo lso 1065 ) , but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics .	39.17546
for this story of an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel , mr . herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles .	39.68079
there are the full-bodied , resourceful voices of robert weede , mimi benzell and tommy rall to make the most of mr . herman ' s lilting melodies and , for an occasional change of pace , the bright humor of molly picon .	19.622894
mr . herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms .	84.050354
not content to create only the music and lyrics , noel coward also wrote the book and directed sail away ( capitol wao 1643	26.834793
stereo swao 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among mr . coward ' s more memorable works .	25.360012
the melodies flow along pleasantly , as mr . coward ' s songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality .	35.964314
elaine stritch , who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness , belts some life into most of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr . coward ' s songs .	32.76099
with three fine russian films in recent months on world war 2 , -- `` the house i live in ' ' , `` the cranes are flying ' ' and `` ballad of a soldier ' ' -- we had every right to expect a real soviet block-buster in `` the day the war ended ' ' .	36.2242
it simply isn ' t , not by a long shot .	14.796258
the artkino presentation , with english titles , opened on saturday at the cameo theatre .	12.081645
make no mistake , this gorky studio drama is a respectable import -- aptly grave , carefully written , performed and directed .	34.34987
in describing the initial allied occupation of a middle-sized german city , the picture has color , pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments .	56.97549
told strictly from the viewpoint of the russian conquerors , the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple , at both sides of the conflict ' s aftermath .	30.539352
unfortunately , the whole picture hinges on this romance , at the expense of everything else .	23.54885
tenderly and rather tediously , the camera rivets on the abrupt , deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher , complicated by nothing more than a friend they don ' t want to hurt .	45.330967
it ' s the old story , war or no war , and more than one viewer may recall hollywood ' s `` titanic ' ' , several seasons back , when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante .	39.925625
under yakov segal ' s direction , it begins stirringly , as crouching soviet and nazi troops silently scan each other , waiting for the first surrender gesture .	60.3967
one high-up camera shot is magnificent , as the germans straggle from a cathedral , dotting a huge , cobblestone square , and drop their weapons .	21.731749
ring of bright water , by gavin maxwell .	5.0363564
only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience .	77.280464
`` ring of bright water ' ' by gavin maxwell is just that -- a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the scottish west highlands .	28.085293
`` he has married me with a ring of bright water ' ' , begins the kathleen raine poem from which maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys .	39.216908
the place is camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of skye .	8.4846
it is a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags , greylag geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters .	17.085796
how maxwell recounts his first coming to camusfearna , his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , is a moving experience .	81.95888
just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough .	102.38663
there is mijbil , an otter who travelled with maxwell -- and gave maxwell ' s name to a new species -- from the tigris marshes to his london flat .	48.465233
it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature .	42.301632
this is not only a compliment to mijbil , of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book , but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub ' s journey by plane from iraq to london , then by train ( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap ) to camusfearna , with affectionate detail .	41.771595
mij , as his owner was soon to learn , had strange , inexplicable habits .	49.013676
he liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth .	37.92587
he preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow .	27.9518
given a small ball or marbles , he would invent games and play by himself for hours .	129.41727
with curiosity and elan , he explored every inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so .	85.31111
a year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader , one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted , but self-discovery as well .	55.92117
in the solitude of camusfearna there had been no loneliness .	13.3335905
`` to be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating	57.355034
it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted , allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses ' ' .	30.473667
now , with the increasing interdependence between himself and mij came a knowledge of an obscure need , that of being trusted implicitly by some creature .	40.501812
two other people in time shared mijbil ' s love `` it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water	117.24167
we were his trinity , and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse , passion and irritation .	30.661228
in turn each of us in our own way depended , as gods do , upon his worship ' ' .	69.50342
the brief details of mijbil ' s death lend depth to the story , give it an edge of ironic tragedy .	107.99105
man , to whom mij gave endless affection and fealty , was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man .	57.989845
but then , through a strange coincidence , maxwell manages to acquire idal , a female otter , and the fascinating story starts once more .	39.714474
one is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book -- mijbil , with his rollicking ways , or maxwell himself , poet , portrait painter , writer , journalist , traveller and zoologist , sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life , in a language at once lyrical and forceful , vivid and unabashed .	41.32864
this reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement .	57.053104
now gavin maxwell ' s ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world .	18.461731
-- the performances of the comedie francaise are the most important recent events in the new york theater .	33.955647
they serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeats , as accurately as possible , the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century .	22.340101
on the contrary , the old plays are continually being reinterpreted , and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the comedie .	51.25386
of course , the well-received revivals last longer than the others , and that further reminds us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism .	26.163834
the directors of the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the broadway producers who , in two instances this season , closed their plays after one performance .	82.804344
but they are aware of the world outside , they court public approval , they delight in full houses , and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic .	124.94995
in france , novel approaches to the classic french plays are frequently attempted .	211.12872
the government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics , and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put moliere ' s characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results .	35.48172
so far as i know , the comedie has never put moliere ' s people in the costumes of the 20th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters .	24.678017
last season , the comedie ' s two principal experiments came to grief , and , in consequence , we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racine ' s `` phedre ' ' and moliere ' s `` school for wives ' ' .	27.809162
the new `` phedre ' ' was done in 17th century setting , instead of ancient greek	44.03619
perhaps that is the comedie ' s equivalent for thrusting this play ' s characters into our own time .	62.513836
the speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately , possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance .	14.548863
a few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent .	48.971333
the new `` school for wives ' ' was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character .	60.253883
among the moliere specialists of some years ago , louis jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns , while fernand ledoux , often performing at the comedie , made them more gross than moliere may have intended .	30.499712
apparently , jouvet and ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in `` the school for wives ' ' .	17.608845
i say `` apparently ' ' although i saw jouvet as arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death	54.508106
by that time , he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy .	36.35815
arnolphe , it will be recalled , is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be .	30.094084
one influential french critic remarked `` pity for arnolphe comes with age ' ' .	72.859245
accordingly , at the comedie last year , jean meyer played a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy .	57.37768
but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly .	370.37604
wisely , the comedie has brought moliere ' s `` tartuffe ' ' on its tour and has left `` the school for wives ' ' at home .	23.390688
tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor ' s wife .	5.2477946
jouvet played him as a sincere zealot , and ledoux , at the comedie , made him a gross buffoon , or so the historians tell us .	46.59166
louis seigner , who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux , is the tartuffe of the present production , which he himself directed .	60.52996
his red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality .	5.118648
but his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory	26.64835
of course , they do not reflect sincerity , but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation .	44.837746
occasionally , seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another .	74.21734
the whole role , by the way , is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen seigner in his other parts .	102.32683
his normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly .	42.997616
here , he is , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness .	15.293493
seigner is the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service .	35.916233
in that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the comedie .	21.646946
we are often told that the comedie has , unfortunately , life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy , drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage .	94.23724
seigner , however , is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company	33.988167
among his other parts are the leads in `` the bourgeois gentleman ' ' and `` the imaginary invalid ' ' .	9.702526
in moliere ' s farce , `` the tricks of scapin ' ' , robert hirsch undertakes another of the great roles .	10.6499815
to begin with , scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master .	26.318138
hirsch ' s scapin is healthy , cheerful , energetic , revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves .	28.713312
hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world .	66.60925
and surely his scapin has a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody ' s servant .	33.098427
django reinhardt , the ill-fated gypsy , was a true artist , one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels .	54.307484
there is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn ' t owe something to django .	33.72071
he told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old armstrong records he bought in the flea market in paris .	65.87229
it was the first jazz he had heard .	74.91719
django , who was born jean baptiste reinhardt in belgium and who died in 1953 in france , was an extraordinary man .	19.088776
most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette .	23.939287
and this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz .	41.778954
you can catch up with him -- if you haven ' t already -- on rca-victor ' s album .	15.294635
`` djangology ' ' , made up of tracks he recorded with stephane grappelly and the quintet of the hot club of france .	29.983269
this is a choice item and grappely deserves mention too , of course .	196.89883
he is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin .	137.38152
they play `` minor swing ' ' , `` honeysuckle rose ' ' , `` beyond the sea ' ' , `` bricktop ' ' , `` heavy artillery ' ' , `` djangology ' ' , `` after you ' ve gone ' ' , `` where are you , my love ' ' ? ?	10.116749
`` i saw stars ' ' , `` lover man ' ' , `` menilmontant ' ' and `` swing 42 ' ' .	9.149443
all this is great proceedings -- get the minutes .	395.7675
kid ory , the trombonist chicken farmer , is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz .	52.153046
he dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans .	32.2639
his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember .	88.24979
good time jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made .	55.14228
wellman braud , bass , and minor hall , drums .	9.571366
the set contains `` high society ' ' , `` do what ory say ' ' , `` down home rag ' ' , `` careless love ' ' , jazz me blues ' ' , `` weary blues ' ' , `` original dixieland one-step ' ' , `` bourbon street parade ' ' , `` panama ' ' , `` toot , toot , tootsie ' ' , `` oh didn ' t he ramble ' ' , `` beale street blues ' ' , `` maryland , my maryland ' ' , `` 1919 rag ' ' , `` eh , la bas ' ' , `` mood indigo ' ' , and `` bugle call rag ' ' .	8.453769
all this will serve to show off the ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems .	98.1976
mischa elman shared last night ' s lewisohn stadium concert with three american composers .	28.344473
his portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin to wit , the mendelssohn and the tchaikovsky .	45.85169
that is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man	33.269627
there were 8 , 000 persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard elman .	110.90035
but , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical .	57.695385
the american part of the evening consisted of paul creston ' s dance overture , william schuman ' s `` chester ' ' from `` new england triptych ' ' and two works of wallingford riegger , dance rhythms , op . 58 , and a romanza for strings , op . 56a .	12.285586
the creston is purely a potboiler , with spanish , english , french and american dances mixed into the stew .	66.491234
the riegger , with its latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale	56.752464
like his sweet , attractive romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his `` non-dissonant ( mostly ) ' ' category of works .	58.760178
the schuman `` chester ' ' takes off from an old william billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect .	30.315994
all these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors .	41.157642
it was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change .	77.82696
we have alfredo antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the stadium symphony .	25.83754
a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of `` a question of adultery ' ' , yesterday ' s new british import at the apollo .	29.51156
since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise , the film ' s extensive discussion of the problem seems , at best , superfluous .	38.12457
in its present artless , low-budget form , the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath .	34.747482
with julie london enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity , the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive .	13.055765
the explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident .	42.28202
anthony steel , as the husband , is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce , labeling her action adulterous .	43.54398
the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of don chaffey , as do basil sydney as his unsympathetic father and anton diffring as an innocent bystander .	26.035765
after a protracted , hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility , the jury , to no one ' s surprise , leaves the legal question unresolved .	43.006668
when the husband drops the case and returns to his wife , both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place .	79.266655
-- for its final change of bill in its london season , the leningrad state kirov ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a `` gala program ' ' at the royal opera house , covent garden .	33.85754
no doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far , it too could give a circus if it pleased .	93.41132
and please it did , in every sense of the word , for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of london audiences .	69.17262
at the end of the program , indeed , there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes , and nothing could stop it .	27.414553
alexandre livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number , `` taras bulba ' ' , but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all .	51.921528
only a plea from the house manager , john collins , finally broke up the party .	45.84485
but for all the manifest intention to `` show off ' ' , this was a circus with a difference , for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level , it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company .	65.77411
the `` taras bulba ' ' excerpt is a rousing version of gogol ' s ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by bo fenster to music of soloviev-sedoi .	4.126898
it is danced by some thirty-five men and no women , and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy , gregarious cavorting , and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt to make the human body perform .	29.103477
yuri soloviev , oleg sokolov , alexei zhitkov , lev sokolov , yuri korneyev and mr . livshitz were the chief soloists , but everybody on stage was magnificent .	21.370785
at the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the petipa-minkus ballet `` bayaderka ' ' , which opened the evening .	18.930622
and why do we in the west know so few of his ballets ? ?	71.14346
this scene is a `` white ballet ' ' in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love ' s spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful `` shadows ' ' who can all dance like nothing human -- which , of course , is altogether fitting .	30.281025
the ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty , as well as loveliness , and adagio is the general medium of the piece .	39.89897
its ballerina , olga moiseyeva , performs simple miracles of beauty , and ludmilla alexeyeva , inna korneyeva and gabrielle komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments .	6.9262505
sergei vikulov , as the lone male , meets the competition well with some brilliant hits , but the work is designed to belong to the ladies .	70.464386
the middle section of the program was made up of short numbers , naturally enough of unequal merit , but all of them pretty good at that .	79.83804
they consisted of a new arrangement of `` nutcracker ' ' excerpts danced stunningly by irina kolpakova and mr . sokolev , with a large ensemble	15.552333
a winning little `` snow maiden ' ' variation by the adorable galina kekisheva	14.653996
two of those poetic adagios in greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by alla osipenko and igor chernishev in one case and inna zubkovskaya and yuri kornevey in the other	14.456143
an amusing character pas de cinq called `` gossiping women ' '	6.6571474
a stirring `` flames of paris ' ' pas de deux by xenia ter-stepanova and alexandre pavlovsky , and a lovely version of fokine ' s `` le cygne ' ' by olga moiseyeva , which had to be repeated .	9.138899
a year ago today , when the democrats were fretting and frolicking in los angeles and john f . kennedy was still only an able and ambitious senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the presidency , theodore h . white had already compiled masses of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960 .	80.534355
as the pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerated , mr . white took more notes .	36.812183
he traveled alternately with mr . kennedy and with richard m . nixon .	27.227787
he asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates ' `` in-groups ' ' .	17.26958
he assembled quantities of facts about the nature of american politics in general , as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest presidential election in american history .	17.696085
those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election	121.98985
how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by mr . white in `` the making of the president 1960 ' ' .	41.322533
this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one .	82.566284
what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history .	30.12901
mr . white , who is only a competent novelist , is a brilliant reporter .	57.75575
his zest for specific detail , his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere , his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book .	44.92161
as a dramatic narrative `` the making of the president 1960 ' ' is continuously engrossing .	28.289532
and as an introduction to american politics it is highly educational .	128.5177
the author begins this volume with a close-up of mr . kennedy , his family and his entourage waiting for the returns .	30.728678
he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential hopefuls five democrats -- senator hubert h . humphrey , senator stuart symington , senator lyndon b . johnson , adlai e . stevenson and mr . kennedy -- and two republicans -- governor rockefeller and mr . nixon .	23.386879
then , in chronological order , mr . white covers the primary campaigns , the conventions and the presidential campaign itself .	38.051014
in the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race , religion , local tradition , bosses , organizations , zealous volunteers and television .	97.873825
mr . white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions .	71.437035
he frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse ' s mouth , from numerous insiders and from mr . kennedy himself	54.420315
but never from mr . nixon , who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust .	31.658037
`` rarely in american history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less ' ' , says mr . white .	114.88332
mr . nixon , he believes , has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign .	42.101494
although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man , mr . nixon , mr . white believes , ignored his own top-level planners , wasted time and effort in the wrong regions , missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television .	47.30718
mr . nixon is `` a broody , moody man , given to long stretches of introspection	80.16795
he is a man of major talent -- but a man of solitary , uncertain impulses .	41.98891
he was above all a friend seeker , almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked .	36.695793
he wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them	77.724045
the least inspiring candidate since alfred m . landon ' ' .	12.953674
mr . kennedy , mr . white believes , `` had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other american could match him ' ' .	140.17072
calm , dignified , composed , `` superbly eloquent ' ' , mr . kennedy always knew everything about everybody .	31.122025
he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers .	53.86865
every decision was made quickly on sound grounds .	2.1850433
efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance .	329.46893
mr . kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters .	15.497275
mr . white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a democrat himself who expects mr . kennedy to be a fine president .	61.346672
throughout `` the making of a president ' ' mr . white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates , how decisions have constantly to be made , how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down , how subordinates play key roles .	172.73592
`` the root question in american politics is always who ' s the man to see ? ?	54.409023
to understand american politics is , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes , who are straw men , who controls , who does not .	89.58669
but to operate in american politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names , establish a warmth , a personal connection ' ' .	69.46979
`` in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion ' ' .	247.00238
`` all platforms are meaningless the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it ' ' .	57.606647
nostalgia week at lewisohn stadium , which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old mischa elman on tuesday night , continued last night as lily pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of french operatic excerpts .	19.580078
miss pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments .	109.937294
the better part of gallantry might be , perhaps , to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown , and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing .	45.720455
no orchestra , however , could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as miss pons encountered last night .	102.110855
in all fairness , there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear , flashes even of the old consummate vocalism .	15.249586
one such moment came in the breathtaking way miss pons sang the cadenza to meyerbeer ' s `` shadow song ' ' .	16.077726
the years suddenly fell away at this point .	3.1385283
on the whole , however , one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on .	67.83338
sharing the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard verreau , making his stadium debut on this occasion .	41.32592
mr . verreau began shakily , with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume .	131.61493
later on this problem vanished , and the `` flower song ' ' from bizet ' s `` carmen ' ' was beautifully and intelligently projected .	11.124542
radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener .	24.578876
lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible .	116.93136
the mushrooming of fm outlets , offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity .	59.544434
not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at negro listeners -- an audience which , in the united states , comprises some 19 , 000 , 000 people with $20 , 000 , 000 , 000 to spend each year .	35.308212
of course , the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching .	59.431026
he even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials .	115.11208
but the growing number of negro-appeal radio stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects .	130.21674
it is estimated that more than 600 stations ( of a total of 3 , 400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the negro .	29.21607
at least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states .	72.982925
these and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers .	39.919926
for 10 years sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio .	69.425415
in the past 10 years , sponsor observes , these trends have become apparent	28.883707
negro population in the u . s . has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent .	67.23752
`` the forgotten 15 million ' ' -- as sponsor tagged the negro market in its first survey -- has become a better-remembered 19 million .	79.671814
advertisers are changing their attitudes , both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it .	63.651676
stations programing to negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational , economic , and cultural levels .	57.101418
futhermore , the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects , not simply serve on the air .	62.247017
in the last decade the number of negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent , and the number of negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent , according to a research man quoted by sponsor .	34.716076
a year ago the negro radio association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business .	79.023
the 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth .	11.003589
it also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed that more than half of the u . s . negroes live outside the southeastern states .	36.86524
also , the state with the largest number of negroes is new york -- not in the south at all .	55.73862
in new york city , wlib boasts `` more community service programs than any other negro station ' ' and `` one of the largest negro news staffs in america ' ' .	47.80942
and wwrl ' s colorful mobile unit , cruising predominately negro neighborhoods , is a frequent reminder of that station ' s round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests .	20.77016
recently , wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit .	110.68659
a half-dozen other stations in the new york area also bid for attention of the city ' s negro population , up about 50 per cent in the past decade .	31.187263
in all big cities outside the south , and even in small towns within the south , radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners .	100.072174
the keystone broadcasting system ' s negro network includes 360 affiliated stations , whose signals reach more than half the total u . s . negro population .	28.72387
one question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the negro is moving into a fully integrated status .	77.00532
whatever the long-range impact of integration , the owners of negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal .	78.64691
advertisers have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests .	81.35376
and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words , working only from a fact sheet .	117.3729
what sets negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows ? ?	24.706959
sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular negro bands and singers	4.1505904
`` race ' ' music , folk songs and melodies , and gospel programs .	33.895058
furthermore , news and special presentations inform the listener about groups , projects , and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station .	59.609234
advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro concern .	387.79703
sponsor quotes john mclendon of the mclendon-ebony station group as saying that the southern negro is becoming conscious of quality and `` does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race	90.56866
he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made negro radio programs famous ' ' .	91.35272
the sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of j . walter carroll of ksan , san francisco	37.05102
`` negro-appeal radio is more important to the negro today , because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires .	65.137054
it will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the negro , seeking to become urbanized , as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life .	37.135174
negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation ' ' .	5.9927206
presentation of `` the life and times of john sloan ' ' in the delaware art center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art .	65.541214
staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate sloan collection by the artist ' s widow , helen farr sloan , to the wilmington society of the fine arts , the exhibition presents a survey of sloan ' s work .	26.227169
from early family portraits , painted before he entered the schools of the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts , the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate .	41.81554
few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived .	42.173748
few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness .	104.12158
the paintings , drawings , prints , and illustrations all reflect the manners , costumes , and mores of america in the first half of the present century .	23.121326
obviously sloan ' s early years were influenced by his close friend robert henri .	104.789665
as early as 1928 , however , the sloan style began to change .	97.37922
the dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette .	5.847505
the solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes .	47.899605
the exhibition presents all phases of sloan ' s many-sided art .	7.716929
in addition to the paintings are drawings , prints , and illustrations .	2.5430205
sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of new york , thereby building for america an incomparable city survey from paintings of mcsorley ' s saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs .	34.646626
one of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is `` sun and wind on the roof ' ' , with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds .	25.345299
although there are landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest is a vista of `` gloucester harbor ' ' in 1915 ) , the human element was the compelling factor in sloan ' s art .	22.966948
significant are such canvases as `` bleeker street , saturday night ' ' , with its typically american crowd ( sloan never went abroad )	102.34328
the multifigure `` traveling carnival ' ' , in which action is vivified by lighting	53.72193
or `` carmine theater , 1912 ' ' , the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ) , although sloan was a member of the famous `` eight ' ' , and of the so-called `` ash-can school ' ' , a term he resented .	34.82722
not all the paintings , however , are of cities .	198.92688
the exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the southwest ( `` koshare in the dust ' ' , a vigorous indian dance , and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ) .	39.518063
the fact that sloan was an extrovert , concerned primarily with what he saw , adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle .	59.39836
there are 151 items in the wilmington show , including one painting by each member of the `` eight ' ' , as well as work by sloan ' s friends and students .	40.564404
supplementing the actual art are memorabilia -- correspondence , diaries , books from the artist ' s library , etc . .	14.407284
all belong to the collection being given to wilmington over a period of years by mrs . sloan , who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with sloan at the art students league , new york , in the 1920 ' s .	76.52995
to enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries , the delaware art center ( according to its director , bruce st . john ) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all sloan works , as well as a card index file .	62.07815
the entire sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians .	107.36966
the current exhibition , which remains on view through oct . 29 , has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources .	96.13509
any musician playing beethoven here , where beethoven was born , is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care .	45.663033
in a sense , he is offering bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did -- the sound of the composer ' s mature style .	84.78441
robert riefling , who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd beethoven festival , penetrated deep into the spirit of the style .	44.327614
his readings were careful without being fussy , and they were authoritative without being presumptuous .	13.640561
the 32 c minor variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another , leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline .	91.62914
the d minor sonata , op . 31 no . 2 , introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios , was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come .	45.865772
these inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of `` opera style ' ' of which beethoven was genuinely capable , but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging .	33.00439
two late sonatas , op . 110 and 111 , were played with similar insight , the disarming simplicities of the op . 111 adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious .	37.15627
the two were separated from each other by the six bagatelles of op . 126 .	9.769376
herr riefling , in everything he gave his large beethoven hall audience , proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority .	148.47086
volker wangenheim , who conducted bonn ' s stadtisches orchester on the following evening , made one more conscious of the process of interpretation .	40.45777
herr wangenheim has only recently become the city ' s music director , and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium .	29.762445
but he weighted the eighth symphony , at times , with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music .	40.273712
he might have been hoping , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the choral fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the ninth	37.81576
but no amount of head-tossing could make it so .	69.27558
the conductor ' s preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the fourth piano concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed , it did so with plenty of spring .	55.53736
the concerto ' s soloist , hans richter-haaser , played with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by herr riefling .	39.94887
his was a burgomaster ' s beethoven , solid and sensible .	54.56048
everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano , chorus , and orchestra in c minor , made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs .	44.60441
the entrance of the stadtisches gesangverein ( bonn ' s civic chorus ) was worth all the waiting , however , as the young rhenish voices finally brought the music to life .	34.172276
the last program of this festival , which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories , brought the cologne rundfunk-sinfonie-orchester and rundfunkchor to bonn ' s gold-filled hall for a performance of the missa solemnis .	29.518534
a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise .	18.40401
but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science .	55.85468
it is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors .	49.614826
these keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge .	35.895714
in the autumn of 1959 , the british broadcasting corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology .	28.639648
three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator .	47.685818
the participants were professor h . bondi , professor of mathematics at king ' s college , london	19.055708
dr . w . b . bonnor , reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college , london	68.09085
dr . r . a . lyttleton , a lecturer at st . john ' s college , cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the university of cambridge	19.59675
and dr . g . j . whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology , london .	57.347706
the programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called , `` rival theories of cosmology ' ' .	41.360462
dr . bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity .	21.850834
first of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds .	28.149328
because of this dr . bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there .	42.93649
this expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years .	44.800194
dr . bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts , that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in .	110.711876
then , after many more billions of years , when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center , this movement will slow down and reverse itself again .	57.557964
he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space .	63.136887
for this reason , he says , the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions .	27.66662
new galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies .	25.443493
if this is true , then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence , even though the universe is expanding .	86.63305
for new galaxies to be created , professor bondi declares , it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years .	40.82936
he contends this idea doesn ' t conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments .	113.3128
dr . lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons .	46.7781
protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other , and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen -- the basic building block of matter .	69.65042
the charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite , but dr . lyttleton is not so sure .	49.465977
suppose , says dr . lyttleton , the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ) .	40.842434
this would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess .	2.0205815
now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms , it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere .	13.2542925
because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) are far more powerful than gravitation , the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere .	25.857117
dr . lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it .	108.07109
this , he claims , would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe .	16.252277
this slim book , while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe , has the appeal that informed conversation always has .	84.91829
several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion , and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field .	57.018593
it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science .	45.09558
presently , the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth ' s atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation .	33.011074
these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth ' s gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories .	18.825132
there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us , giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions .	43.9615
in doing away with the tea tray , the elephants and the giant tortoise , science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos .	15.05157
and although the universe may forever defy understanding , it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man .	105.06329
`` roots ' ' , the new play at the brand-new mayfair theater on 46th st . which has been made over from a night club , is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an english farm girl .	49.25945
highly successful in england before its transfer to new york , most of `` roots ' ' is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy .	36.759148
only in its final scene , where beatie bryant ( mary doyle ) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts .	40.890556
the burden of mr . wesker ' s message is that people living close to the soil ( at least in england ) are not the happy , fine , strong , natural , earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine .	157.24432
rather they are genuine clods , proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought .	26.194822
they care no more for politics , says mr . wesker , than they do for a symphony .	50.41743
seeming to have roots in the soil , they actually have none in life .	97.73318
they dwell , in short , in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived .	34.910522
but this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as mr . wesker dedicates to it .	60.484806
so much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been living in a gilded palace , perhaps , and wants a real big heap of contrast ) .	70.61184
the messy meals , the washing of dishes , the drying of clothes may be realism , but there is such a thing as redundancy .	36.02271
miss doyle as beatie has a great fund of animal spirits , a strong voice and a warm smile .	44.226093
she is just home from a sojourn in london where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating , including a dose of good british socialism .	44.52199
but while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her , ronnie has not been able to observe her progress , and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull , he sends beatie a letter of dismissal .	77.77836
beatie , getting no sympathy for her misfortune , soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom .	46.63187
despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech is convincing , and we see why british audiences apparently were impressed by `` roots ' ' .	52.49658
there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play , including william hansen ' s impersonation of a stubborn , rather pathetic father , and katherine squire ' s vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin ' nonsense from her daughter , or anyone else .	30.09536
but i am afraid mr . wesker ' s meat and potatoes dish isn ' t well seasoned enough for local audiences .	26.016785
shakespeare had a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupted wednesday night ' s `` much ado about nothing ' ' opening the season of free theatre in central park .	77.0433
the new york shakespeare festival , which is using the wollman memorial skating rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed , began bravely .	31.042915
joseph papp , impassioned founder of the festival and director of `` much ado ' ' , had a vibrant , colorful production under way .	38.7409
using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with shakespeare ' s words in a spirited mixture .	34.283295
the audience filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence .	10.352979
the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick , so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult , raised chuckles .	49.220566
the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges , also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers ' heads , evoked laughter .	84.26307
the vivacity of the masquers ' party at leonato ' s palace , with the spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon , cast a spell of delight .	27.745037
as `` much ado ' ' turned serious while the insipid claudio rejected hero at the altar , a sprinkle began to fall .	51.270008
at first hardly a person in the audience moved , although some umbrellas were opened .	63.8342
but the rain came more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart .	89.692955
the grieving hero and her father , leonato , followed by the friar , left the stage .	24.471899
a voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes .	107.70527
some remained in the wollman enclosure , fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads .	37.89738
others huddled under the trees outside the fence .	2.4820914
twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still raining , the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped .	41.892815
beatrice ( nan martin ) and benedick ( j . d . cannon ) took their places on the stage .	26.175838
in their very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare , like a nostradamus , had foreseen this moment .	28.613762
said benedick `` lady beatrice , have you wept all this while ' ' ? ?	15.889297
replied beatrice `` yea , and i will weep a while longer ' ' .	56.74297
the heavens refused to give up their weeping .	15.522435
the gallant company completed act 4 , and got through part of act 5 .	185.62787
but the final scenes could not be played .	5.085266
if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out , let them take comfort .	40.289013
the parks department has done an admirable job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare .	20.69442
one could hardly blame newbold morris , the parks commissioner , for devoting so much grateful mention to the department ' s technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains .	52.329086
eldon elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and shakespeare ' s lighthearted mood .	42.981297
mr . papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace , although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable .	39.588146
elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints .	64.422966
still a demurrer or two must be entered .	18.528528
for style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her .	86.82079
if the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible .	60.448936
put to the service of lieder of schubert , brahms , strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision .	22.753557
but what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism .	13.443949
instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , miss schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside .	99.68788
clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic .	46.838238
there was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect .	56.3821
the result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness .	44.767113
there were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication .	50.653328
miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , john wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition .	20.26368
all the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills	24.591515
miss schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .	77.21736
the dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8 , 500 of them ) had a much better time of it at lewisohn stadium on saturday night than all had had two nights earlier , when stadium concerts presented the first of two dance programs .	81.58704
on saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved .	84.50293
there was , additionally , a bonus for the saturday-night patrons .	14.284176
alvin ailey and carmen de lavallade appeared in the first new york performance of mr . ailey ' s `` roots of the blues ' ' , a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the boston arts festival .	21.41354
otherwise , the program included , as on thursday , the taras-tchaikovsky `` design for strings ' ' , the dollar-britten `` divertimento ' ' , the dollar-de banfield `` the duel ' ' and the pas de deux from `` the nutcracker ' ' .	9.225659
maria tallchief and erik bruhn , who danced the `` nutcracker ' ' pas de deux , were also seen in the petipa-minkus pas de deux from `` don quixote ' ' , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely .	22.901186
among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening , elisabeth carroll and ivan allen were particularly impressive in their roles in `` the duel ' ' , a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants .	34.54518
mr . ailey ' s `` roots of the blues ' ' , an earthy and very human modern dance work , provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening .	56.03902
as brother john sellers sang five `` blues ' ' to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce langhorne and shep shepard , mr . ailey and miss de lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic .	14.907138
their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan .	43.437347
he wore the clothes of a laborer , and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress .	18.86516
the cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions .	33.380028
`` roots of the blues ' ' may not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact .	52.483234
`` perhaps it is better to stay at home .	9.747371
the armchair traveler preserves his illusions ' ' .	1.6495907
this somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` blue skies , brown studies ' ' , a collection of travel essays by william sansom , who would never consider staying home for long .	27.552208
mr . sansom is english , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between .	112.80356
the only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell sitwell , mr . sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an american multimillionaire ( his fourth ) .	34.862854
the result is rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices .	80.73975
there are sixteen essays in `` blue skies , brown studies ' ' .	10.014936
most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines .	52.107132
but , even if mr . sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound .	142.17104
too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another .	142.808
mr . sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of english , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references .	30.095505
`` i like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smells and looks like , its color , its particular kind of life ' ' .	45.78907
this is an exact description of what mr . sansom does .	23.043703
he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions .	114.07885
it is an over-all impression mr . sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past .	45.978962
william sansom writes only about europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london , vienna , the french riviera and the norwegian fjords .	36.58471
but no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions .	84.20512
`` a writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment ' ' , he says .	14.3070345
`` beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all .	92.1767
to transmit that feeling he writes ' ' .	1.4334548
this may not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of mr . sansom .	17.204382
so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st . torpetius that still persists in st . tropez	19.061607
at the sun and the heat of mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an englishman than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas city	74.09051
at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world ' s finest restaurants , la bonne auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the nice airport	10.368979
mr . sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of bernini and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto .	30.538012
he can coin a neat phrase `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people ' '	25.756002
tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel ' s ears ' '	5.6335697
after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity ' ' .	5.0517626
and , for all his lacquered , almost byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison .	22.40625
in one of his best essays mr . sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio himself that dot the environs of vicenza .	23.855112
how far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence mr . sansom reminds us thus	126.85391
`` the white colonnaded , cedar-roofed southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied england to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue south , the palladian orbit stretching out from vicenza the old mind of andrea palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep , his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips ' ' .	49.9413
`` blue skies , brown studies ' ' is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs .	40.385174
in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio .	85.589325
wbai , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void .	41.172363
yesterday it offered `` poised for violence ' ' , by jean reavey .	7.8626184
wbai is on the right track in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue to demonstrate .	116.60659
unfortunately , `` poised for violence ' ' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point .	93.04999
mrs . reavey ' s work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-broadway production in the fall -- and , in addition , employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged .	51.552303
the play ' s device is to explore society ' s obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist ' s models who remain part of someone else ' s painting rather than just be themselves .	89.49592
in a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty .	44.912563
somewhere in mrs . reavey ' s play there is both protest and aspiration of merit .	60.38956
but its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener ' s stamina begins to wilt .	65.95036
moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind ' s ills .	22.560019
but quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author ' s words .	58.00569
which in itself is an immediate reward of the wbai experiment	58.211178
good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration .	101.01198
a weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month .	14.09753
titled `` what ' s new in music ' ' ? ?	4.0031095
the enterprising program is heard saturday afternoons on radio station aj .	98.33325
the brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze .	119.26202
the show is programed and written by the station ' s assistant continuity editor , chuck briefer .	60.08885
the first saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings .	18.69295
last saturday ' s interesting melange included ernst toch , karlheinz stockhausen , richard yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new `` space ' ' opera by the swedish composer , karl-birger blomdahl .	14.96032
other saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected american composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country .	57.663155
it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene .	34.387356
but one wishes , when the appetite is whetted , as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions .	53.180367
the moiseyev dance company dropped in at madison square garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long american tour to a close .	54.396587
it is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york engagement earlier this season , but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody ' s heart .	124.804596
it is good to see those numbers again .	10.773355
the `` suite of old russian dances ' ' that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical moiseyev vigor and warmth	44.47664
the amusing `` yurochka ' ' , in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance	26.08191
the lovely ( and of course vigorous ) `` polyanka ' ' or `` the meadow ' '	6.666267
the three moldavian dances entitled `` zhok ' '	1.0848429
the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called `` bul ' ba ' '	3.3225138
and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` city quadrille ' ' are all just as good as one remembers them to have been , and they are welcome back .	73.31883
so , for that matter , are the newer dances -- the `` kalmuk dance ' ' with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by sergei tsvetkov called `` the platter ' ' , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` summer ' ' , `` the three shepherds ' ' of azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of course , the trenchant `` rock ' n ' roll ' ' .	20.657585
as autumn starts its annual sweep , few americans and canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world ' s finest fall coloring .	56.338345
spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth .	49.021767
the only other regions so blessed are the british isles , western europe , eastern china , southern chile and parts of japan , new zealand and tasmania .	22.504969

michigan , wisconsin and minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of september well into october , especially in their northern sections , e . g . , wisconsin ' s vilas county whose colorama celebration is sept . 29-oct . 8 .	37.965023
in wisconsin , take route 55 north of shawano or routes 78 and 60 from portage to prairie du chien .	15.574184

carson mccullers , after a long , painful illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul , has come back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller lists even before official publication .	65.67192
though the subject -- segregation in her native south -- has been thoroughly worked , miss mccullers uses her poet ' s instinct and storyteller ' s skill to reaffirm her place at the very top of modern american writing .	36.678658
with an art that almost conceals art , j . d . salinger can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurts .	23.223839

of the nation ' s eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat -- at least in that broad balmy region that lies below america ' s belt line .	70.611
waterways are busy right now from the virginia capes to the texas coast .	10.050982

a year ago it was bruited that the primary character in erich maria remarque ' s new novel was based on the marquis alfonso de portago , the spanish nobleman who died driving in the mille miglia automobile race of 1957 .	14.695176
if this was in fact mr . remarque ' s intention he has achieved a notable failure .	17.70284
clerfayt of `` heaven has no favorites ' ' resembles portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas portago was a good one .	49.735016
he is a dull , unformed , and aimless person	52.335102
the twelfth marquis de portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate .	3.3377569
one looked forward to mr . remarque ' s ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised .	119.68023
unhappily , `` heaven has no favorites ' ' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list .	139.85246
mr . remarque ' s conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble .	221.98564
he proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery .	50.097153
his heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay .	35.48193
her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen .	112.02231
between the first meeting of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement , mr . remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of europe , and a modicum of automobile racing .	23.315836
the ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of it all are distressing	55.35567
the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming	38.306034
the automobile racing bears little relation to reality .	4.359718
this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer .	55.099358
hazards to life and limb on the golf course , while existent , are actuarially insignificant .	22.799612
race-drivers , on the other hand , are quite often killed on the circuit , and since it was obviously mr . remarque ' s intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm , one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes .	61.472412
the jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have been , although i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature .	85.190056
perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal .	5.484327
the book carries a disclaimer in which remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing .	49.130253
the necessity is not clear to me , and , in any case , to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car , which , or whom , he calls `` giuseppe ' ' , parked `` on the place vendome sneering at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces parked around him ' ' is not a liberty	42.693306
but it is in the matter of preoccupation with death , which is the primary concern of the book , that remarque ' s failure is plainest .	27.028282
clerfayt is neurotic , preoccupied , and passive .	2.7435815
to be human , he believes , is to seek one ' s own destruction the freudian `` death-wish ' ' cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers .	110.60245
in point of fact , the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live .	82.09268
a clerfayt may moon on about the face of death in the cockpit	50.432793
a portago could say , as he did say to me , `` if i die tomorrow , still i have had twenty-eight wonderful years	60.44908
i ' ll live to be 105 ' ' .	1.2641298
clerfayt , transported , may think of the engine driving his car as `` a mystical beast under the hood ' ' .	25.11156
the italian master piero taruffi , no less sensitive , knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car ' s adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae .	31.196375
clerfayt , driving , sees himself `` a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell ' '	15.222441
the briton stirling moss , one of the greatest virtuosi of all time , believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet .	73.534615
errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything mr . remarque hoped to tell us .	136.12846
however , my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers , pilots , submariners , atomic researchers , and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists .	19.28378
the west is leaderless , according to this book .	85.50966
in contrast , the east is ably led by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev , tito , and mao .	8.17075
against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all .	67.25763
it is field marshal montgomery ' s belief that in most western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or christianity	46.762775
about 30 per cent call themselves christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable , and only the last 10 per cent are genuine christians and believers in democracy .	55.60019
but these western countries do care about themselves .	2.7633882
if , say , the russians intended to stop tom jones ' going to the pub , then tom jones would fight the commies .	45.62065
but he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it -- such as `` cause ' ' .	97.35656
for all practical purposes , the west stands disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership .	11.6134615
with this barrage , montgomery of alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the west .	7.4733973
never given to mincing words , he places heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly america .	146.94319
at war ' s end leadership in western europe passed from britain because the labour government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state .	63.250004
with britain looking inward , overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the united states .	43.228573
`` america gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike ' ' .	65.08472
she pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity , but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace .	36.842957
america has divided more than she has united the west .	85.004456
the reasons are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars , and that she compulsively strives to be liked .	34.08222
however , she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed .	216.15395
but the greater reason for fumbling , stumbling american leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at pearl harbor .	102.98678
`` they are determined ' ' , montgomery writes , `` not to be surprised again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary , but also creates nervousness among other nations in the western alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible ' ' .	38.194683
the net result is that under american leadership the general world situation has become bad .	133.65231
to `` monty ' ' , the american people , who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight , `` now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war ' ' .	48.738575
as faulty as has been our leadership clearly the united states must be relied upon to lead .	24.05776
montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the west ' s own house in order .	53.144005
such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group , a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence .	76.20914
this leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the united states , namely that russia will agree to a reunited germany , that the east german government does not exist , that events in japan in june 1960 were communist-inspired , that the true government of china is in formosa , that mao was the evil influence behind khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may 1960 , and that either china or russia wants or expects war .	60.894405
such a leader must strengthen nato politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talked .	89.402985
after drastically overhauling nato , western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the east and west .	21.53073
major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories , say by 1970 .	40.17828
but the east would have to show sincerity in carrying it out ' ' .	37.801563
`` but where is the leader who will handle all these things for us ' ' ? ?	18.439833
montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy .	60.469177
the man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is de gaulle .	47.899006
he alone has the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision .	18.81157
but de gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring france ' s lost soul .	24.824375
whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership .	110.708336
the leader montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself , lead a carefully regulated and orderly life , allow time for quiet thought and reflection , adapt decisions and plans to changing situations , be ruthless , particularly with inefficiency , and be honest and morally proper .	83.15265
all in all , montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him .	69.67318
in looking as far back as moses , thence to cromwell , napoleon , lincoln , churchill , and nehru , montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men .	26.722303
he believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by churchill , who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for hitler ' s war .	52.248493
however , montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice .	123.39377
most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said , and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene .	54.146957
like eisenhower , he holds the militarist ' s suspicion of politicians .	24.47832
however , at the same time montgomery selects as his hero de gaulle , who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions .	24.159573
`` monty ' ' shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support .	54.969357
for the most part , his writing rambles and jogs , preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts .	42.116592
nevertheless , montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world .	12.008469
it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership .	91.08739
and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events .	171.02512
it is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer `` live ' ' for the first time only after he has died .	61.701145
but then , mario lanza was no common singer , and his whole career , public and non-public , was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first `` recital ' ' only when he has ceased to be a living voice .	36.19968
it is a kind of justice , too , that it should originate in london ' s royal albert hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if not the greatest , performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( rca victor lm 2454 , $4 . 98 ) .	47.75772
to be sure , lanza made numerous concert tours , here and abroad , but these did not take him to new york where the carping critic might lurk .	37.019726
the reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in u . s . life , but none is so varied , vast and vigilant as the eating public .	77.27217
the department of agriculture averaged out u . s . food consumption last year at 1 , 488 lbs . per person , which , allowing for the 17 million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry every night , means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs . or more a day .	71.16776
that mother hen of the weight-height tables , the metropolitan life insurance co . , clucks that 48 million americans are overweight .	43.526524
through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough .	79.904465
for the first time in history , the u . s . has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the government ' s most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce .	39.270515
in this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume .	83.09264
refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage .	16.751982
and in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new american interest in how what people eat affects their health .	56.6413
to eat is human , the nation is learning to think , to survive divine .	105.441605
not all the concern for health is well directed .	144.21179
from the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the u . s . has progressed to curds , concentrates and capsules .	6.9542303
each year , reports the american medical association , ten million americans spend $900 million on vitamins , tonics and other food supplements .	18.26051
at juice bars in los angeles ' 35 `` health ' ' stores , a new sensation is a pink , high-protein cocktail , concocted of dried eggs , powdered milk and cherry-flavored no-cal , which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz . glass .	20.325512
grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all .	83.43497
but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of u . s . scientists wants to supply them .	56.71589
the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the university of minnesota ' s physiologist ancel keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime k ( for keys ) ration and author of last year ' s bestselling eat well and stay well .	50.59631
from his birch-paneled office in the laboratory of physiological hygiene , under the university ' s football stadium in minneapolis ( `` we get a rumble on every touchdown ' ' ) , blocky , grey-haired dr . keys directs an ambitious , $200 , 000-a-year experiment on diet , which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing .	40.84368
pursuing it , he has logged 500 , 000 miles , suffered indescribable digestive indignities , and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10 , 000 individuals , from bantu tribesmen to italian contadini .	13.737837
he has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades ) of neapolitan firemen , studied the metabolism of finnish woodcutters , analyzed the `` mealie-meal ' ' eaten by capetown coloreds , and experimented on minneapolis businessmen .	13.859248
keys ' s findings , though far from complete , are likely to smash many an eating cliche .	67.782936
vitamins , eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on ( though mothers ' milk is still the ticket ) .	134.40048
readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks , are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack .	30.717224
already many an american knows his count , and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ) .	43.60874
out of cholesterol come keys ' s main messages so far	95.52205
the typical u . s . daily menu , says dr . keys , contains 3 , 000 calories , should contain 2 , 300 .	37.548454
and extra weight increases the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart attack .	22.809116
with meat , milk , butter and ice cream , the calorie-heavy u . s . diet is 40% fat , and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind , says dr . keys , that increases blood cholesterol , damages arteries , and leads to coronary disease .	19.419947
throughout much of the world , food is still so scarce that half of the earth ' s population has trouble getting the 1 , 600 calories a day necessary to sustain life .	63.55508
the deficiency diseases -- scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra -- run rampant .	13.616228
in west africa , for example , where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace is kwashiorkor , or `` red johnny ' ' , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kills more than half its victims , leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease .	37.23759
in the well-fed u . s . , deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years .	20.178106
today , as harrison ' s principles of internal medicine , a standard internist ' s text , puts it , `` the most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity ' ' .	20.865053
puritan new england regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin .	16.64335
says keys `` maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think ' ' .	55.955845
morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him .	62.706814
the simple mechanical strain of overweight , says new york ' s dr . norman jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built ' ' .	49.083084
the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums .	41.722607
he has -- for unclear reasons -- a 25% higher death rate from cancer .	151.49298
he may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable , because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement .	30.960333
physiologically , people overeat because what dr . jolliffe calls the `` appestat ' ' is set too high .	31.06361
the appestat , which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant , is located , says jolliffe , in the hypothalamus -- near the body ' s temperature , sleep and water-balance controls .	62.226364
in moderate doses , alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail )	31.389677
but because liquor has a high caloric value -- 100 calories per oz . -- the heavy drinker is seldom hungry .	15.045094
in rare cases , diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently , destroying nearly all sense of satiety .	36.892952
far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion .	29.874708
it may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother ' s nagging .	50.96655
some families place undue emphasis on food conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .	64.74632
the result says jolliffe `` the child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life ' ' .	34.172783
food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does .	73.71756
reports dr . keys `` a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .	77.16418
he may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys .	81.71058
so she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .	6.8572774
it ' s a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she ' s being deprived of something else ' ' .	28.893625
for the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won .	41.711895
physiologist keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( benzedrine , dexedrine ) as dangerous `` crutches for a weak will ' ' .	23.303642
keys has no such objections to metrecal , quaker oats ' s quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters .	42.404655
`` metrecal is a pretty complete food ' ' , he says .	4.6039004
`` it contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals .	3.3072786
in the quantity of 900 calories a day , anyone will lose weight on it -- 20 , 30 or 40 lbs . ' ' .	56.373524
but keys worries that the metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food .	49.450848
despite his personal distaste for obesity ( `` disgusting ' ' ) , dr . keys has only an incidental interest in how much americans eat .	21.170002
what concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation ' s no . 1 killer coronary artery disease , which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500 , 000 americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents .	33.22938
cholesterol , the cornerstone of dr . keys ' s theory , is a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol .	12.295343
scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the greek chole , meaning bile , and sterios , meaning solid ) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells , since it accounts for about 2% of the brain ' s total solid weight .	38.770042
they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones .	3.4583545
they suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system .	21.369558
but they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver .	63.29662
although the fatty protein molecules , carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol , are water soluble , cholesterol itself is insoluble , and cannot be destroyed by the body .	54.12744
`` a remarkable substance ' ' , says dr . keys , `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries ' ' .	22.011889
when thus deposited , keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks .	27.701986
explains keys as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary artery .	9.790986
the proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind .	38.3065
as cholesterol piles up , it narrows , irritates and damages the artery , encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation .	13.52818
eventually , says keys , one of two things happens .	12.470957
a clot forms at the site , seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack .	31.285286
or ( more commonly , thinks keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery ' s flow to the point that an infarct occurs the heart muscle is suffocated , cells supplied by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injured .	52.875107
ordinarily , the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body ' s needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile .	33.90419
even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eaten in normal amounts , says dr . keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood .	14.961411
during world war 2 , , doctors in the netherlands and scandinavia noted a curious fact despite the stresses of nazi occupation , the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping .	39.532894
not until long after the war -- 1950 , in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason .	40.845684
that year , sweden ' s haqvin malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods .	21.274603
that same year the university of california ' s dr . laurance kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal fats cause them to rise .	34.894337
here keys and others , such as dr . a . e . ahrens of the rockefeller institute , took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each .	39.79782
all natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated .	8.645877
the degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule .	11.950185
mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens .	26.665916
the three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz . ) , but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol .	18.296555
as a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed .	53.26888
just what is meant by `` spirit ' ' and by `` matter ' ' ? ?	11.343486
the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all .	78.64214
yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do .	51.012344
for in the modern world neither `` spirit ' ' nor `` matter ' ' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience .	69.19645
we are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected .	47.098934
when the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .	51.55921
one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit .	33.075375
just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities .	75.83109
not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true .	82.03211
demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars .	70.10184
in such a world the words `` matter ' ' and `` spirit ' ' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all .	41.779594
in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .	118.41
the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it .	84.166336
in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit .	89.60143
the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .	158.12404
science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .	77.48064
when , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .	114.79389
in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions .	29.420366
there have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .	47.107826
all this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .	11.697411
the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .	105.58711
the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit .	79.2879
although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever .	93.7534
we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience .	51.604244
there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .	42.35938
science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives .	31.737167
the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur miller ' s play the crucible , which deals with the salem witch trials .	58.404743
as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century .	15.487254
aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .	43.785748
the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age .	39.35963
there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .	38.281567
instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion .	65.51925
a teenage girl , abigail williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the reverend samuel parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings .	97.314415
for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .	40.095055
as the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .	38.212254
everyone in salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept up by it .	23.793306
it is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with abigail and parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .	31.07221
it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction .	54.30272
the audience leaves the play under a spell , it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes .	78.86972
if one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit ' ' .	79.73205
this is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience .	69.16886
in the end the good man , john proctor , expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says , `` a fire , a fire is burning ! !	35.06005
i hear the boot of lucifer , i see his filthy face ' ' ! !	25.667
the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them .	79.17048
we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .	48.941326
yet are not we of the mid-twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing ' ' as the devil , just as bad off as they -- only in a different way ? ?	53.904068
in our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .	79.525566
we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false .	61.070015
even mr . miller himself seems uncertain on this score .	26.27028
in a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point `` however , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifer ' s many-faced lieutenants .	40.28011
and his belief is not to his discredit .	5.6429596
better minds than hale ' s were -- and still are -- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken ' ' .	68.002335
( page 33 ) on the other hand , a little later on he says `` since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out god ' s beard and the devil ' s horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes .	48.551395
the concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas .	50.702892
when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man ' s worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state ' ' .	70.13343
apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real .	230.39714
yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem .	40.692486
it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power .	63.849266
it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .	55.34327
for this does not account for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell .	42.065372
the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author ' s convictions to the contrary .	27.786112
there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit .	111.80863
apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence .	56.01751
think , for example , of the spirit of the marine corps .	10.00248
surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .	20.326912
we cannot , of course , assign it any substance .	128.91377
it is not material and is not a `` thing ' ' occupying space and time .	34.872288
yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .	47.733498
so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team , the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan .	57.65861
every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity .	21.250986
in searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful .	34.287937
for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit .	112.225204
it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere .	28.06625
it is the spirit which is the source of a community ' s drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers .	55.995773
yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community .	63.163925
the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas .	119.22188
one characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .	7.4296103
the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them .	146.09879
it is for them a given which they and they alone possess .	265.507
the spirit of the marine corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it .	75.49041
it is they , of course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it .	64.74524
if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people ' ' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .	46.55006
this does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .	49.94304
the absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents bultmann ' s intention .	28.351732
his point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the christian kerygma .	25.96147
when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding of existence .	40.44917
mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols ' ' or `` ciphers ' ' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .	22.976406
the statement is often made that when bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith ' ' .	18.258677
if bultmann ' s own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .	36.175056
nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .	35.377697
on the contrary , even in the heart of `` the bible belt ' ' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man ' s picture of himself and his world .	56.8683
in fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of bultmann ' s argument is disclosed .	27.760857
although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .	43.418926
this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .	26.04749
time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist ' ' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .	30.924
the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-protestantism ' ' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american churches .	28.533197
in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion ' ' current in the situation .	58.143406
this is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent peale ' s `` cult of reassurance ' ' or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .	21.695591
but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .	29.236744
however , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .	36.701664
to be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock ' ' and `` the great crowd ' ' and to take solace from paul ' s castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise ' ' in the opening chapter of first corinthians .	19.019905
but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?	15.009198
can the church risk assuming that the `` folly ' ' of men is as dear to god as their `` wisdom ' ' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of god ' ' and `` the foolishness of men ' ' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?	21.633574
can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?	72.81124
there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the greeks rather than from the bible ) that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .	34.876114
by analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world ' ' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .	45.26515
but , as scripture everywhere reminds us , god does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by god ' s providence , presents it .	64.66465
and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .	49.69765
until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .	104.26616
in arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved	41.708485
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .	123.387825
but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .	24.69776
this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .	58.015648
if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no , or where i do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian .	64.5479
expressed differently if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .	34.46428
this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .	45.61322
modern man , as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age ' '	29.574642
and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward	51.759293
and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .	62.115223
in any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us .	63.337166
to say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .	34.86922
we have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal ' ' tradition in protestant christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of schleiermacher , ritschl , herrmann , harnack , and troeltsch , and more recently , schweitzer and the early barth and , in part at least , bultmann .	38.552555
it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong .	26.756655
for we must number here not only the names of bushnell , clarke , and rauschenbusch , not to mention those of `` the chicago school ' ' and macintosh , but those of the brothers niebuhr and ( if america may claim him ! !	49.142166
finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal ' ' movement that developed at the university of chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of alfred north whitehead .	23.623049
what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .	59.389584
although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity .	34.40465
they have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to god , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .	96.386215
when we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .	55.18571
however much we may have to criticize liberal theology ' s constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .	65.65673
in affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which bultmann ' s attempt to formulate such a theology has led .	25.02812
for we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .	50.85832
if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right ' ' is clearly untenable .	17.126827
whereas bultmann ' s `` center ' ' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right ' ' , as represented , say , by karl barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .	44.602165
it follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left ' ' , which has been represented on the continent by fritz buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in american and english theology .	46.49921
in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .	100.09374
we may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by bultmann , barth , and buri .	45.697372
to do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third ' ' possibility is a meaningless question .	59.25149
thus , if what is at issue is whether `` all s is p ' ' , it is indifferent whether `` some s is not p ' ' or `` no s is p ' ' , since in either case the judgment in question is false .	68.45351
hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted	88.603165
for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .	28.343866
therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of buri and barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of bultmann .	39.955425
it will be recalled from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the `` right ' ' , as represented by barth , rests on the following thesis the only tenable alternative to bultmann ' s position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation	33.396614
( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation	66.90507
and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that , from bultmann ' s point of view , are mythological .	70.24264
one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of christendom .	32.965466
representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman and anglican churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the holy office in 1864 .	40.149464
now again in 1961 , in england , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as christian unity .	60.837086
the church unity octave , january 18-25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches .	28.123722
many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .	58.293537
but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the catholic side .	52.804646
for the `` tide is well on the turn ' ' , as the london catholic weekly universe has written .	59.60352
i came to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman .	53.59876
as an american catholic of irish ancestry , i came with certain preconceptions and expectations	44.613148
being intellectually influenced by newman and the general 19th-century literature of england , i knew only a protestant-dominated country .	64.724525
since arriving here , however , i have formed a far different religious picture of present-day england .	104.143234
in representing part of this new picture , i will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments	49.915005
but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england .	91.010284
since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my roman collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman catholic cleric .	65.82576
in any case , i have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by englishmen , even in devonshire and cornwall , where anti-catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .	19.624569
nowhere have i seen public expression of anti-catholicism .	8.570772
on my first guy fawkes day here , i found catholics as well as non-catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .	37.992207
a birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` the true story of guy fawkes ' ' , which began	38.917015
`` when you pile your `` guy ' ' on the bonfire tomorrow night , i wonder how much of the true story of guy fawkes you will remember ? ?	21.723701
in the 355 years since the first guy fawkes night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder ' ' .	42.974995
the article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1 .	33.53133
in spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of newman and other tractarians of the 1840 ' s and 1850 ' s , the catholic segment of england one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or 800 , 000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public .	43.938667
the return of the catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .	30.61485
in 1864 newman professedly had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers .	67.66929
now , in 1961 , the catholic population of england is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million )	25.178442
yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .	5.6044135
a protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham oratory ( catholic ) church on sunday mornings .	49.382504
she found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of english people are churchgoers .	37.538116
she may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten .	114.18344
from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services .	231.59853
a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university , following anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated mass before more than a hundred .	38.126766
the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches .	122.28385
according to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england , the `` total of confirmed members is 9 , 748 , 000 , but only 2 , 887 , 671 are registered on the parochial church rolls ' ' , and `` over 27 million people in england are baptized into the church of england , but roughly only a tenth of them continue ' ' .	41.23317
an amazing article in the manchester guardian of last november , entitled `` fate of redundant churches ' ' , states than an archbishops ' commission `` reported last month that in the church of england alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time .	65.09992
a further 260 anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 ' ' .	12.918484
and in the last five years , the `` methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels ' ' .	46.553608
most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither anglicans nor nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics ' ' , and have done so .	49.94884
while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are going to church .	81.31331
it should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ) .	30.026764
still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that protestants are decreasing and catholics increasing .	114.48619
an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .	16.371664
a century ago , newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism , and that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own ' ' .	110.6314
that day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call england a `` protestant country ' ' .	62.4345
one of the ironies of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real christians to unite .	39.767467
many english catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .	35.64754
the london universe devoted its centenary issue last december 8 to mapping out various aspects of catholic progress during the last one hundred years .	69.67218
with traditional nationalistic spirit , some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism at its best .	26.111847
i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics .	60.03297
it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses at mass .	88.74147
they hope , of course , to reclaim the non-catholic population to the catholic faith , and at every sunday benediction they recite by heart the `` prayer for england ' '	43.407967
`` o blessed virgin mary , mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon england , thy `` dowry ' ' , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .	49.17067
intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief shepherd , the vicar of thy son .	45.624054
' ' a hymn often to be heard in catholic churches is `` faith of our fathers ' ' , which glories in england ' s ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims `` faith of our fathers mary ' s prayers shall win our country back to thee ' ' .	41.246494
the english saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs and cardinal newman will soon be canonized .	31.109457
because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , english catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` un-english ' ' .	16.82247
i have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in the air .	34.09531
for example , a writer in a recent number of the queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un-english ' ' ' .	33.580883
in this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of irish catholics , priests and laity , in england , while certainly seen as good for catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic english catholics , especially when these irishmen offer to remind their christian brethren of this good .	36.967453
one of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities .	29.408178
at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .	61.379295
moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .	66.52288
now , not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-catholic members of the university .	42.85038
catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the cherwell with non-catholic students .	6.090864
further evidence that roman catholicism enjoys a more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it in the mass media of england .	59.119522
the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches .	37.441452
on successive sundays during october , 1960 , paul ferris ( a non-catholic ) wrote articles in the observer depicting clergymen of the church of england , the church of rome and the nonconformist church .	20.74126
the catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best .	250.01265
there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman .	64.879395
such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-victorian england .	16.007326
there was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on b . b . c . , where comments were equally made by an anglican parson , a free church minister and a catholic priest .	37.624043
catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergymen .	31.534523
a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool , dr . heenan , and the anglican archbishop of york , dr . ramsey , recently appointed archbishop of canterbury .	14.601708
the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england .	91.54411
the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months .	29.116785
and it was interesting to observe that b . b . c . ' s television film on christmas eve was the bells of st . mary ' s .	7.962418
of course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr . fisher , then anglican archbishop of canterbury , to the vatican last december .	33.241146
it was the first time an english primate has done this since the 14th century .	35.429462
english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope .	223.06784
almost daily something is reported which feeds this catholic hope in england statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants	58.774414
news of a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit	43.432915
a report that a catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters	36.51262
the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` catholics , if the present system is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third of the house of lords in the next generation ' '	55.27686
a report that 200 protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave .	25.573977
the death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal .	22.110115
the straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality .	60.257187
but how can one figure symbolize both ? ?	1.010303
christianity declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur .	16.39058
perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as irenaeus .	41.504326
to be the savior and the lord , jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own	54.987286
he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man ' s history .	52.894917
yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind .	156.64114
his history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it .	65.07689
his death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus .	22.725193
each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .	55.29315
not a circle , then , nor a straight line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it	44.435905
for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .	4.0889664
as represented by a spiral , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself	106.22149
the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam .	25.13492
as origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ .	16.44913
`` whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? ?	34.925
from god ' s will and wisdom , and from virgin earth .	164.49458
for ' god had not rained ' , says the scripture , before man was made , and there was no man to till the earth .	50.615616
from this earth , then , while it was still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man , the beginning of humanity ' ' .	60.887115
irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity .	129.76938
adam and eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection .	54.691246
irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul	39.238678
therefore there is no need for him , as there is for origen , to identify existence itself with the fall .	80.86968
existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history .	22.559706
the biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words `` so god created man in his own image	108.34183
in the similitude of god he created him ' ' .	2.919554
there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement `` if the ( holy ) spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature	53.621613
and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image ( of god ) in his formation , but not receiving the similitude ( of god ) through the spirit ' ' .	42.384632
thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster	25.31823
the similitude of god , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature .	46.38191
recent research on irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction .	40.548847
he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall	20.21833
for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .	25.658361
therefore irenaeus describes man ' s creation as follows	4.104373
`` so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against god his creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards god , a law was given him by god , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .	43.809635
and he laid down for him certain conditions so that , if he kept the command of god , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal	50.03772
but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken ' ' .	52.38555
these conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal	55.052353
yet he did not stop being human as a result .	18.08422
there is no justification for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god ( humanity ) and the similitude of god ( immortality ) .	34.038826
man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil ' s promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality .	59.15043
he was , in the words of irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality ' ' .	17.204561
the true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this .	47.33396
for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin .	21.562162
and even as she , having indeed a husband , adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race	85.33312
so also did mary , having a man betrothed ( to her ) , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race ' ' .	56.35933
because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created as children , irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked ' ' .	44.537018
his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin mary .	31.012617
that parallelism affects his picture of man ' s disobedience too	199.31625
for as it was christ , the word of god , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe .	43.78417
with this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .	56.906197
at the nadir of that circuit is death .	2.470704
`` along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience	69.34055
wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that ( moment ) they were handed over to it ' ' .	54.63849
this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a friday , as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday	38.23841
he sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath .	112.126564
in any case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .	54.17846
man ' s life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with god , must now be conformed to the shape of death .	36.05196
nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to god , and he still rules .	90.20262
even death , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function .	39.977413
`` wherefore also he ( god ) drove him ( man ) out of paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because he envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because he pitied him , ( and did not desire ) that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable .	46.616283
but he set a bound to his ( state of ) sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take place in the earth , so that man , ceasing at length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to god ' ' .	47.746555
this idea , which occurs in both tatian and cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of irenaeus ' theology	40.46195
for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ .	115.60264
as man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that christ could bring many to life .	102.489494
it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is .	30.526817
it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next .	145.06369
it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality .	74.00619
this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man ' s fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the greek-speaking ones .	38.620983
they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .	46.99494
death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .	37.730267
it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time .	64.659966
these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .	32.57926
the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated .	69.67042
such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether adam ' s life was intended to be part of the process of time .	72.29145
if it was , then it must have been god ' s intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity .	25.03641
one night , so some of these theories run , adam would have fallen asleep , much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve	76.75625
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal .	63.452396
the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change .	66.66133
on the other hand , christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .	10.517677
it is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .	37.12289
if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator .	46.327236
this seems to have been the conclusion to which origen was forced .	39.33372
if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i . e . , created , existence .	62.241436
such an interpretation of death radically alters the christian view of creation	255.58772
for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .	250.61028
because christianity teaches not only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ .	26.844059
furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes .	53.90453
the unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the back bay -- and parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners .	65.9945
ezra stiles gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .	35.374146
even so , gannett judiciously argued , the association could legitimately decide that parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness ' ' .	47.955917
we today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .	43.18813
one can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture to the first church , and so to suppress it , rather than let parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .	78.734406
finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as gannett ' s son explained in the biography of his father , they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of christians .	30.519474
their demand against the calvinist orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry ' ' to the extreme of proclaiming christianity a `` natural ' ' religion .	45.004753
grant all this -- still , when modern unitarianism and the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults parker lavished upon them , or else argue that after all parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience .	64.2724
whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker leave the association , while it may plead that dr . n . l . frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` the difference between trinitarians and unitarians is a difference in christianity	36.768208
the difference between mr . parker and the association is a difference between no christianity and christianity ' ' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the association never quite brought itself officially to expel parker .	71.84831
had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the harvard divinity school assemble today to honor parker ' s insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi ' ' .	57.05577
happily for posterity , then , the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .	68.04447
fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus bartol defended parker ' s sincerity , as did also gannett and chandler robbins	32.059826
whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room , though not out of the fellowship .	45.141922
in the hall , after adjournment , dr . frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly theodore again burst into tears .	45.278793
all this near tragedy , which to us borders on comedy , enables us to tell the story over and over again , always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency .	35.174774
it was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of new england ( which we inherit ) did triumph .	80.66418
to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .	59.143375
yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of harvard university for having done the abject penance for its rejection of ralph waldo emerson ' s the divinity school address of naming its hall of philosophy after him .	58.55851
in both cases the stubborn fact remains liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily .	53.284325
suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ? ?	124.98505
is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ?	45.30257
however , there is a crucial difference between the two histories .	14.562061
emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him he walked out of the unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .	35.43393
parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the fellowship to throw him out .	58.539104
hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .	44.832527
he still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat .	56.140007
actually , the dispute between parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one .	69.288994
it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him .	30.419397
the fact is incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .	23.709705
parker , along with garrison and charles sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the mexican war and slavery .	46.3529
nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace	18.934786
their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut .	11.853027
but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .	40.71862
even though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us .	38.098587
it has been endlessly rephrased , but i may here put it thus at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant ? ?	96.26128
and then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for the first time about themselves ? ?	50.092163
there can be no doubt , the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior .	33.99133
the gentle channing , revered by all bostonians , orthodox or unitarian , wrote to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action `` no city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .	78.00426
we stand more in awe of one another than most people .	97.0146
opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron ' ' .	41.639267
even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , channing added -- remember , this is channing , not parker ! !	120.09463
-- that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart , should he `` speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurried into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy ' ' .	76.71417
channing wrote this -- in a letter ! !	1.5782508
i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .	42.858757
but theodore parker , commencing his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a `` twenty-eighth congregational church ' ' which bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the unitarian churches ) , made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum .	30.213453
because he spoke openly with what channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- parker vindicated channing ' s further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines .	54.043858
an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license .	53.179756
by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , i am sure , come to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest .	60.010475
he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at the least , resentment .	77.94633
what otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters ' ' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' holy , holy , holy is the almighty dollar ' `` ? ?	38.284824
nor , when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as parker snarled at them thus `` talk about the catholics voting as the bishop tells ! !	78.19292
there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome , but to the almighty dollar , a pope much nearer home .	59.519173
boston has been controlled by a few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think ' ' .	38.20441
and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them `` even the unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse than those who deceived them ' ' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed .	39.38002
it was `` duty ' ' he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty .	86.07407
parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents .	29.945156
`` if it gave me pleasure to say hard things ' ' , he wrote , `` i would shut up forever ' ' .	32.57351
we have to tell ourselves that when parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , `` but the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , i must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire ' ' .	61.67691
because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people ' s consciences .	24.693619
our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the four gospels .	50.87297
it is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the water into wine at eleven a . m . on the third of august , a . d . 32 .	60.352077
we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .	14.861626
so we are the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass on , happily forgetting both him and the entire episode .	64.69556
we have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial andrews norton , by saying that , while he believed jesus `` like other religious teachers ' ' , worked miracles , `` i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine ' ' .	44.25491
i have , within the past fifty years , come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt .	53.404194
it has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this .	62.96719
i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world .	58.625504
in an amateurish , yet in a very real sense , i have followed the developments of archaeology , geology , astronomy , herpetology , and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields .	13.523102
at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a `` higher criticism ' ' of the bible , to refute which i felt the need of a better knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology , for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure .	40.903202
doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , bible-emancipated race .	40.26658
although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book , i stood outside shivering in the cold .	47.609966
in one thing the higher critics , like the modernists , however , overreached themselves , in claiming that the gospel of john was not written in john ' s time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as 150 a . d . .	34.04212
now , if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking through his servant , it is john ' s gospel .	54.726856
to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god , is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible .	54.822166
here i took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to which we might give the modern name of pragmatism , or the thing that works .	44.668655
test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle .	39.110832
so , i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself , and then tested it to see how it worked .	124.14737
as a short , possibly not the best method , i looked up `` word ' ' in the concordance and noted that the bible claims from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god ' s personal message to man .	63.881153
the next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly `` science ' ' , and i submitted to its conditions according to christ ' s invitation and promise that , `` if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of god , or whether i speak of myself ' ' ( john 7 17 ) .	59.621544
the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god , son of man by the virgin mary , the saviour of the world .	32.924393
i believe , therefore , that we are without exception sinners , by nature alienated from god , and that jesus christ , the son of god , came to earth , the representative head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receives christ as his personal saviour is `` born again ' ' spiritually , with new privileges , appetites , and affections , destined to live and grow in his likeness forever .	39.22093
nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable `` moral life ' ' , although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues .	94.61916
i now ever look for christ according to his promises and those of the old testament as well , to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth .	57.209885
to state fully what the bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends .	76.952675
the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body .	74.605515
again , as faith reveals god my father and christ my saviour , i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love , wisdom , power and prayer .	86.603226
i place his precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability , dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to him .	55.52608
i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ , who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and daring to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world .	53.67056
our lord ' s invitation with its implied promise to all is , `` come and see ' ' .	33.651264
i stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain .	27.459402
as i ministered to his needs , i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord .	50.869213
in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said , `` peace i leave with you , my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth , give i unto you .	88.33301
let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid ' ' .	19.875326
what a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise tendered by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him .	54.46126
he was about to leave them , to depart from this world , and return to his father in heaven .	49.699795
before he left them he promised that his peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds .	46.7271
i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ .	45.86501
it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lord ' s guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients .	27.944456
how often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room , asking for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and his creatures .	68.8418
looking unto god , the prophet isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago `` thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee ' ' .	68.90462
are you longing for peace in your heart ? ?	3.270591
such a calm and assuring peace can be yours .	41.723392
as only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family , likewise one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are his own .	35.2816
perhaps you do not know if you belong to him .	14.73728
you may know that you are in god ' s family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father .	50.442043
`` god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life ' ' , and `` as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name ' ' .	26.491894
it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he gives his peace	94.35618
not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy .	93.57627
why not open your heart to the lord jesus christ now , accept him as your saviour and let him fill you with peace that only he can give .	59.26723
then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say	113.03746
`` i am resting today in his wonderful peace ,	89.78843
i am kept from all danger by night and by day ,	70.264984
and his glory is flooding my soul ' ' .	1.4542147
our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer space , which have captured the imagination of the american public .	29.245813
cape canaveral ' s achievements thunder forth from the radio , television , and newspaper .	25.72771
while we are filling outer space with scientific successes , for many the `` inner ' ' space of their soul is an aching void .	34.699078
an average of 50 suicides are reported in america each day ! !	85.36227
one out of every three or four marriages ends in divorce ! !	211.6452
over $200 , 000 , 000 is paid yearly to the 80 , 000 full-time fortune-tellers in the united states by fearful mankind who want to `` know ' ' what the future holds ! !	29.33572
delinquency , juvenile and adult , is at an all-time high ! !	34.094048
unfortunately , in our rush to beat the russians , we have forgotten these truth-packed words of jesus christ `` what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world ( that includes outer space ) , and lose his own soul ? ?	41.3514
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ' ' ? ?	23.708378
gaining outer space and losing `` inner ' ' space is bad business according to god ' s standards .	62.004223
it is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments	78.26394
but we must not forget man ' s soul .	49.413445
is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news that god put his son , jesus christ , on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls ? ?	56.154305
`` for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life ' ' ( john 3	18.093178

your spiritual `` inner ' ' space helps determine the spirituality of america as a nation .	10.936078
we trust you are not one of the 70 , 000 , 000 americans who do not attend church , but who feel that various forms of recreation are more important than worshipping the god who made our country great .	38.982704
is forgiveness of past sins , assurance of present help , and hope of future bliss in your orbit ? ?	63.54526
or are you trying the devil ' s substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within ? ?	98.07701
pleasure , fame and fortune , drowning your troubles with a drink , and `` living it up ' ' with the gang are like candy bars when you ' re hungry they may ease your hunger temporarily , but they ' ll never take the place of a satisfying , mouth-watering steak .	38.43301
no amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of your `` inner ' ' space .	15.423287
because your soul was made to be filled with god himself , not religious functions `` about ' ' him .	173.11241
that is why the bible commands you to `` taste and see that the lord is good blessed ( happy ) is the man that trusteth in him ' ' ( psalm 34 8 ) .	46.885857
you can receive god into your heart and life by a step of personal faith .	105.967476
accept the sinless son of god , jesus christ , as your own personal saviour .	20.133276
`` as many as received him ( jesus ) , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name ' ' .	42.520027
`` the lord is my light and my salvation	1.3563888
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	3.7320037
a certain teacher scheduled a `` fear party ' ' for her fourth grade pupils .	27.970745
it was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears , to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely .	39.764774
the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks `` wouldn ' t it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries ' ' ? ?	40.783707
dr . george w . crane , a medical columnist , thinks it would .	35.474007
he says `` that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously .	149.93552
each week an estimated 20 million patients call upon us doctors .	91.3495
of this number , 50% , or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever .	76.78492
yet they keep running from one physician to another , largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles .	83.03957
one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions ' ' .	65.938515
we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days .	29.232122
people are giving their doctors a hard time .	5.2342234
one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles , and he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened	83.54668
30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control	174.70158
12% of them worried about their health , although their ailments were imaginary	36.26875
10% of them worried about their friends , neighbors , and relatives , most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves .	47.35315
only 8% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention .	138.37125
well , most of our fears may be unfounded , but after you discover that fact , you have something else to worry about why then do we have these fears ? ?	63.94354
what is the real cause of them ? ?	1.0895413
what is there about us that makes us so anxious ? ?	197.32469
look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries .	29.488562
we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers .	17.053879
we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks , and more billions on other forms of gambling .	34.5787
we spend billions of dollars on liquor , and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment .	39.678852
we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moment ' s relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart .	37.444202
a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks , and after he had seen it all , he said to a friend `` you must be a very sad people ' ' .	29.989412
`` sad ' ' was not the right word , of course .	33.13424
he should have said `` jittery ' ' , for that ' s what we are .	57.84938
watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something .	51.9864
in one of his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates .	33.577473
yes , and as tension mounts in this world , fear is increasing .	65.388725
does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business ? ?	53.2146
we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons , dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate .	55.02634
i doubt that `` fear parties ' ' and `` group confessionals ' ' will help very much .	30.675798
suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ? ?	50.069096
isn ' t that where most of them are already -- right out on the front page of our newspapers ? ?	77.67862
maybe we are talking about them too much .	16.893713
the question is what are we going to do about them ? ?	20.173088
meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can .	50.411976
hitler did just that 23 years ago , building up tensions that first led to a munich and then to a world war .	89.94269
the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise , or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate .	48.544014
it is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack .	53.159668
it could have the same effect on communists .	6.0999966
the president of the united states has said `` we will never negotiate out of fear , and we will never fear to negotiate ' ' .	17.010635
that is a sound position , but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid .	66.3322
and that ' s another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears , to develop the poise that promotes peace .	13.842383
turning to the word of god , we find the only sure way to do that .	58.269382
in psalm 27 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you , or to drive them out if they have you in their grip `` the lord is my light and my salvation	61.062355
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	3.7320037
well , you say , those are beautiful words all right , but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day .	66.57826
he didn ' t live in a world of perpetual peril like ours .	21.00971
he didn ' t know anything about the problems we face today .	280.63782
read the next two verses `` when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .	66.26243
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me , in this will i be confident ' ' .	131.59955
that is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today , isn ' t it ? ?	22.540958
our enemy is also threatening to devour us .	3.0376153
he has already devoured huge areas of the world , putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire , reducing them to slavery , systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls , and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison .	43.364716
yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us .	16.079168
what a terrible thing , that `` wailing wall ' ' in berlin ! !	47.046623
a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family .	37.66684
another man tried to swim across the river from the east to the west , but was shot and killed .	27.123785
a middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall , she threw out a few belongings and then jumped	28.282316
the entrance to a church has been walled up , so that the congregation , most of which is in the western sector , cannot worship god there anymore .	78.17897
practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city .	25.29482
people stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings , weeping , pounding it with their fists , pleading for loved ones .	36.46002
but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity .	26.476702
there is only one escape left , a tragic one , and too many people are taking it suicide .	65.338326
the normal rate of suicides in east berlin was one a day , but since the border was closed on august 13 it has jumped to 25 a day ! !	57.595932
these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door .	155.7304
we are all involved in them , deeply involved .	126.97738
and there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world .	18.050264
he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world `` the lord is my light and my salvation	37.868404
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	3.7320037
notice that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret of his faith .	38.97761
first , `` the lord is my light ' ' .	2.285581
he lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark .	20.33494
the same god who called this world into being when he said `` let there be light ' ' ! !	59.058495
-- those were his very first creative words -- he began the world with light -- this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness .	69.877304
for those who put their trust in him he still says every day again `` let there be light ' ' ! !	191.05403
in fact , he came into this world himself , in the person of his son , jesus christ , who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said `` i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life ' ' .	42.337074
the psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ .	87.62646
he could only see the light coming over the horizon .	6.241361
we live in the bright daylight of that great event	1567.063
for us it is a fact in history .	6.28389
why should we not have the same faith , and an even greater experience of the light which it gives ? ?	110.12187
this is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of god `` the lord is my salvation ' ' .	29.93711
he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins .	22.005472
if god could do that , he could do anything .	32.3138
the enemies at his gate , threatening to eat up his flesh , were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul .	64.10617
and god had conquered that one by his grace ! !	65.49295
so why worry about all the others ? ?	1.0191331
the apostle paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament `` he that spared not his own son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him freely give us all things ? ?	93.61724
if god be for us , who can be against us ? ?	29.489061
who shall separate us from the love of christ ? ?	7.009497
shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ' ' ? ?	8.161671
this is the key to the conquest of fear .	56.93537
this gets down to the heart of our problem , for it reconciles us with god , whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against him .	52.45386
when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ , when we know that he is our savior , that he has paid our debt with his blood , that he has met the demands of god ' s justice and thus has turned his wrath away -- when we know that , we have peace with god in our hearts	49.21004
and then , with this god on our side , we can face the whole world without fear .	38.563686
and so the psalmist gives us one more picture of god `` the lord is the strength of my life ' ' .	14.416667
the word is really `` stronghold ' ' .	2.0285587
it recalls those words of another psalm `` god is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .	123.96085
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come , behold the works of the lord , what desolations he hath made in the earth .	45.065506
but , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century a . d . , when an arabic scholar , tabit ibn korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three .	42.546333
thus , while it remains possible that the babylonians and/or the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .	89.88588
the `` lo shu ' ' square as an expression of centrality	6.430622
the concept of the middle kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the warring states , was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the ch ' in dynasty ( 221-207 b . c . ) .	35.56926
but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .	9.782773
among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor , shih huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity , was the burning of the books in 213 b . c . , with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking	25.702868
but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared .	38.411087
many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast ch ' in palace some ten years later	79.7075
yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 b . c . to a . d . 220 ) .	41.803017
in fact , during the first century b . c . , an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called `` wei books ' ' , a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination .	27.906092
however , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 .	12.200906
after all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu , which was already semisecret anyhow .	32.51079
but , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the han period .	75.46403
although modern scholars have expressed surprise that `` the simple magic square of three ' ' , a mere `` mathematical puzzle ' ' , was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself .	29.95196
but , up to now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts .	39.925884
such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu , 5 , was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram .	25.141851
the importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .	47.559505
indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram .	20.858921
if one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals .	44.53851
then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45	69.27541
and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed .	46.993988
furthermore , the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position	81.96689
it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 .	54.198208
in fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese .	37.24637
for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature	52.581055
and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( yin ) numbers , were all equal to each other .	95.15405
thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .	24.513979
the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality .	53.21706
these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty .	7.508425
the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century b . c . , when the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the most auspicious influences .	70.99199
his immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the lo shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter ' s efficacy .	43.30975
after this time , inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one ' s self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest .	39.97651
later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally .	395.63934
all this emphasis on centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 b . c . , also may conceivably have led to the development of the five-elements school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five .	53.406895
we find , for example , such groupings as the five ancient rulers , the five sacred mountains , the five directions ( with center ) , the five metals , five colors , five tastes , five odors , five musical notes , five bodily functions , five viscera , and many others .	46.403324
this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest	63.644817
but why did the old chinese postulate five elements , when the ancient near east -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four ? ?	111.38925
and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ?	82.69639
obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives , and that may have been the workings of the lo shu .	8.942984
this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking .	126.42433
whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought .	61.0434
scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries .	68.88688
yin and yang in the `` lo shu ' ' square	9.38982
although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders .	26.49608
for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time .	40.37489
as such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu	68.21724
but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it .	55.00525
the chinese world view during the han dynasty , when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang and five-elements school , which was traditionally founded by tsou yen .	22.458551
according to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by heaven , t ' ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a supreme sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the tao , which can be roughly interpreted as `` the order of the universe ' ' or `` the universal way ' ' .	35.816696
heaven , acting through the tao , expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles , the yin and the yang .	24.485037
the yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the sun	51.594776
while the yin , or female principle , flourished in darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the moon .	26.956358
together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything .	61.991627
we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang , while the even numbers were yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center .	66.626564
during the han dynasty , another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo shu , considering the latter as a plan of ancient china .	24.815304
instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence yin )	91.24027
taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china .	54.067352
thus the middle number , 5 , represented sung-shan in honan , central china	23.728067
the 3 , t ' ai-shan in shantung , east china	30.08949
the 7 , hwa-shan in shensi , west china	4.0747366
the 1 , heng-shan in hopei , north china ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring shansi )	45.665764
and the 9 , huo-shan in anhwei , which was then the south sacred mountain .	56.856968
for the rivers , the 4 represented the huai , to the ( then ) southeast	50.4235
the 2 , the san kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) southwest	38.46217
and the 6 , the ( upper ) yellow river in the northwest .	52.922188
note that by western standards this plan was `` upside down ' ' , as it put north at the bottom and south at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered	25.837908
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps .	115.41718
the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces	5.5913243
and whenever the lo shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion .	20.99873
few persons who join the church are insincere .	3.7024
they earnestly desire to do the will of god .	3.6889045
when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve christian stature , it is an indictment of the church .	21.72767
these fatalities are dramatic evidence of `` halfway evangelism ' ' , a failure to follow through .	24.119396
a program of lay visitation evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship .	95.7513
the work of lay visitation evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been interviewed .	160.33192
in the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to christ and the church .	57.341747
the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program .	87.62433
the first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the church .	60.46811
churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active .	33.000546
this is the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency ' ' .	26.769613
it is important that persons desiring to unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant .	53.270123
it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications .	51.42163
preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received .	185.51768
the pastor writes a personal letter to each individual , expressing his joy over the decision , assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time , and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday .	42.29589
some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors .	64.62939
it should not be postponed later than the next day .	22.014545
a helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter .	28.636795
the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference .	147.77295
if possible , he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present .	54.023876
it is definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference ' ' .	1.8966866
he will discuss the significance of christian commitment , the necessity of family religion and private devotions , and the importance of the membership preparation sessions .	24.53273
there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel .	39.833702
each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer .	15.7192135
a piece of devotional material , such as the upper room , may be left in each home .	68.93341
a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults .	18.066362
those who join the church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows .	35.888115
they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them .	85.51981
many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes .	89.12797
others meet on sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights .	25.108723
some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between .	151.47572
following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week .	139.94606
this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet .	167.90402
most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday .	78.45764
in this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church .	25.283733
the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life , service opportunities , the church school , missions , men ' s work , women ' s work , youth program , social activities , and finances .	43.390892
the budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session .	15.85446
an `` interest finder ' ' or `` talent sheet ' ' may be filled out by each person .	37.54804
) the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments .	28.205805
the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members .	26.077312
in conducting the membership preparation-inquirers ' class , the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class .	65.47068
some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each , generally held on sunday night or during the week .	66.17187
this gives greater opportunity for the learning process .	5.536057
use dramatization -- for example , in discussing the lord ' s supper or church symbolism .	43.36663
some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session .	49.901535
some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly .	17.273823
urge them to write out their questions for the box .	18.584518
use a textbook with assigned readings each week .	10.275909
select class members for reports on various phases of the study .	7.506274
conduct examinations , using a true-false check sheet .	16.843906
ask each member to write a statement on such topics as `` what christ means to me ' ' , `` what the church means to me ' ' , `` why join the church ' ' , `` the duties of church members ' ' , etc . .	17.762327
assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized .	1.8995792
invite class members to share in an extra period of bible study each week .	125.99986
ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service .	21.082033
there is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training , including those coming by transfer of membership .	42.477306
george e . sweazey writes `` there is danger in trying to make admission to the church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened ' ' .	50.72705
people appreciate experiences that demand something of them .	9.724808
those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule .	24.37719
for most of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this is a recent development in many churches .	88.4162
those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed .	21.265793
the preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another .	29.453701
it provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations .	20.28166
the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church .	27.23587
this should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience .	34.34054
they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages .	84.22872
every detail of the service merits careful attention -- the hymns , the sermon , the ritual , the right hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation .	21.29591
this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation .	26.333015
it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church .	23.61906
it can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay .	40.203995
the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church .	91.04996
the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .	139.95439
psychologically the reception should be the climax , following the sermon .	64.216064
ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete `` talent sheets ' ' and pledge cards .	50.53771
some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register .	87.72504
provide a name card for each new member .	7.0565305
arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together .	56.165203
invite sponsors or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service .	27.23302
give each new member a certificate of membership .	6.915018
introduce each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation .	21.012312
lead the congregation in a response of welcome .	2.784981
have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service .	69.16652
take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board .	103.576385
have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests .	38.457825
chapter 6 planning for the assimilation and growth of new members	27.056122
the church is `` the family of god ' ' .	1.6208844
the members of the `` family ' ' are drawn together by a common love for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom .	37.72194
every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .	25.456852
yet the most difficult problem in the church ' s program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship .	62.60061
very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive .	20.155277
a study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years .	38.2611
one denomination had a membership of 1 , 419 , 833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at 1 , 541 , 991 -- a net growth of only 122 , 158 .	22.459885
yet during the same period there were 1 , 080 , 062 additions .	5.281271
another major church body had 4 , 499 , 608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4 , 622 , 444 .	15.350811
during this time 4 , 122 , 354 new members were brought into the fellowship .	32.550232
still another denomination had 7 , 360 , 187 members twenty years ago .	8.72789
during this period 7 , 484 , 268 members were received , yet the net membership now is only 9 , 910 , 741 .	59.144054
these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership .	29.258028
this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship .	109.91805
studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received .	110.45161
the local `` family of god ' ' has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare .	75.86017
new members can become participating , growing members .	88.77723
but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life .	46.582188
the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process .	33.417007
if the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way .	36.125008
those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest .	138.54059
however , it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship .	52.51808
when they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians .	98.12084
the church expects certain things of those who become members .	153.49985
the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family	167.36838
-- opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible	8.307348
care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands .	136.93803
the statement also points to a classic paradox the more men turn toward god , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .	98.15303
to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race .	42.685936
massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .	55.405716
the words of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind `` oh how we hate one another for the love of god ' ' ! !	35.456467
the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify .	65.550026
institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion .	39.79522
a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms	30.002392
to escape this fate , it must rule some things out .	99.59823
for every criterion which defines what something is , at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not .	47.977036
some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether	163.75986
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches .	145.54335
man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .	78.28092
having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance .	55.25251
to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools .	85.85589
both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible .	70.41511
as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him .	79.478035
yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .	141.62938
is there any way out of the predicament ? ?	5.958272
the only way that i can see is through communication .	243.61955
interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries .	53.271797
approached creatively , it is a high art .	3.0351613
it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart god ' s intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary .	68.4367
in a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states .	13.534932
what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ?	24.192745
i shall touch on three areas personal , national , and theological .	48.028767
by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure .	415.32678
some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate .	51.37231
modern psychology has shown that paralleling `` the authoritarian personality ' ' is `` the bigoted personality ' ' in which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally .	23.589949
fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us .	24.06931
to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .	31.508173
interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever .	32.163635
it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies .	67.292305
while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable .	38.114017
the specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century .	25.4356
emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires .	16.149796
no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since world war 2 , , and the number is growing by the year .	23.702997
as an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and non-christians in these lands .	32.508003
colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other .	51.99593
actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture .	30.043356
nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries .	64.175446
the truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and volksgeist which these young nations very much need .	107.71996
insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else ' s .	46.728973
all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which christian missions stand .	59.956787
africans and asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .	114.620125
the people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , christians on the mainland of china .	14.983795
for example , in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion .	34.60054
in 1960 ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7 , 000 , 000 buddhists and the lament of its 800 , 000 roman catholics .	32.18152
again , india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone .	64.54128
the progressive closing of afro-asian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo .	63.63253
i was seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists ' world radio program .	69.98103
he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them .	56.789608
after returning to the united states and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available .	45.698627
it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval	37.730583
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .	22.51143
it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-christian sentiment .	30.94902
ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since world war 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs .	51.53091
although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and non-christians in asia , the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions themselves .	47.459904
the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims	2.830351
neither has the establishment of the state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews .	37.160053
the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form .	100.92652
the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ' ' .	66.668106
one of our foremost jurists , david dudley field , has gone so far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history ' ' .	63.198692
the trend throughout the world ' s religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment .	46.28029
pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a muslim state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation .	52.276413
`` what is the point ' ' , charles adams reports the pakistanis as asking , `` in demanding an islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is ' ' ? ?	77.56262
the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular .	45.836464
and while the nation was formerly named `` the islamic republic of pakistan ' ' , it is now simply `` the republic of pakistan ' ' .	8.906478
the new regime in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor .	9.420254
the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months .	73.236435
during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties .	33.954044
now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise .	41.046528
and in this country gustave weigel ' s delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state .	54.75317
the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father weigel ' s theological argument .	59.560505
everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine .	40.507595
my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them .	129.57368
that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed .	97.00258
i do not mean to imply that christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit .	51.594654
leslie newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says , `` we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it ' ' .	34.746624
newbiggin ' s qualification on the christian claim is of considerable significance .	39.962666
the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of its priests , father feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church .	21.17206
in mentioning this under `` salvation reconsidered ' ' i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is .	31.142473
when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit ' ' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean .	41.290703
of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows .	85.19961
yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man ' s own action .	38.47996
i mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit ' ' .	23.72976
he is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general .	67.280815
he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good .	140.74261
he is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both	217.95628
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences .	91.64802
this is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit ' ' an evil result means .	69.56154
it means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends .	182.83748
of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permits ' ' , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action .	43.459236
certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives , `` it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative ' ' .	36.403625
naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken into account .	35.667015
especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited .	114.002716
presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account .	53.45
there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm .	74.18037
if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic , speculative , and future evil .	54.732075
nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences .	49.65234
he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action .	68.93042
above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction .	43.09156
he does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit ' ' in the sense explained .	67.95812
by contrast , a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done	39.208267
and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone ' s doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based .	54.866596
mr . philip toynbee writes , for example , that `` in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues .	68.49527
if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin ' ' .	40.447983
against such a termination of human life on earth by human action , he then proposes as an alternative that we `` negotiate at once with the russians and get the best terms which are available ' ' , that we deliberately `` negotiate from comparative weakness ' ' .	57.7839
he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i . e . , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by russia within a few years .	36.46108
this would be by far the better choice , when `` it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish ' ' .	34.486885
nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified it is `` a possible result , however improbable ' '	142.59319
`` the worst , and least probable ' ' result	24.219505
`` if it didn ' t prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing ' '	38.137302
for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ' ' .	15.287121
if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test ' ' `` have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are ' ' ? ?	66.96095
thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality	91.629616
it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done .	55.088432
several of the replies to mr . toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .	42.846848
`` it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation ' ' .	45.46272
`` i am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .	122.81837
but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced ' ' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?	45.873898
) `` quoting mr . kennan ' s phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ' ' .	33.189182
`` if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter ' ' .	44.999405
`` if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , i think he is right .	42.70928
i do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war ' ' .	8.376108
even professor arnold toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms `` compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .	50.44034
let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be ' ' .	65.4533
mr . philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four , if he believed communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil ' ' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world .	37.37857
even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday ' ' .	10.291461
no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature .	131.17516
but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .	38.546894
on their way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation .	48.299084
not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand .	59.611763
toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment .	98.97466
`` i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation ' ' .	34.029358
would such an act of refusal be useful ? ?	13.52987
he does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that `` if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender ' ' .	34.27335
he wants to be `` brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far , far more hopeless than was the hungarian revolution of 1956 ' ' .	32.29203
this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world ' s arsenal of unlimited weapons .	43.64906
it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .	68.08027
`` it is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples .	69.29279
hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop ' ' .	35.630505
this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last	124.52217
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .	24.990036
the only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war	45.90901
and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race .	75.470184
that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted ' ' effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures .	110.05862
finally , just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing , by human action , to accelerate this end .	44.431812
we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind ' s thrusts toward we know not what future .	87.793
much more than shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of `` belonging ' ' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being .	50.792995
for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most americans .	66.83655
few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders .	65.58952
this pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics	79.11033
it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country .	39.591885
it is not surprising that , as spokesman for real estate interests , the national association of real estate boards ( nareb ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure .	38.8138
how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?	108.08465
what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ? ?	33.519276
what ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? ?	128.29588
what social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ?	63.146492
recently , a group of the faculty at wesleyan university ' s public affairs center sought some answers to these questions .	43.112885
several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .	15.009149
here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .	171.08597
for a number of years , wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy .	45.072945
this article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .	77.34649
such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .	29.053215
within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public ' ' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them .	61.81706
professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner .	104.95689
but as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community .	94.630936
obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor ' s role .	29.089487
judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers ' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction	306.37683
and whether these would qualify them for `` congenial ' ' , `` happy ' ' relations to other people in certain community areas .	31.070513
how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of nareb ' s code of ethics article 34 in the code , adopted in 1924 , states that `` a realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood ' ' .	48.797955
though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such `` detrimental ' ' influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid .	72.88704
the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms	101.877846
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas .	96.43462
they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals ' ' but agitators for some kind of `` cause ' ' or `` reform ' ' , and this was no longer to be a `` pro ' ' .	24.22032
obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional ' ' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one ' s work .	35.237156
these men -- for the most part educated in our `` best ' ' new england colleges , well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a `` client-service relationship ' ' .	68.070465
this narrow `` professionalism ' ' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .	43.116318
as our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the `` client relationship ' ' as an interpretation of their `` way of operating ' ' became evident .	47.262115
realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc . .	39.77341
from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding .	128.51814
it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue	85.286674
( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes	56.61983
and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro ' ' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .	51.96871
( 1 ) most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .	82.22627
the commission on race and housing concluded that `` there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced , on the whole , than any other segment of the american population ' ' .	28.841606
but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices .	29.298658
also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed .	84.91343
like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make .	58.155937
realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension .	53.735973
recent studies by the commission on race and housing and others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion .	125.4485
there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the negroes ' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc . .	39.428524
data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in .	105.15305
often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically .	51.141926
significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the university of california press ) that present the commission ' s findings .	62.119457
no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised .	51.67079
the role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration .	91.98803
relevant `` facts ' ' , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of `` harmonious ' ' neighborhoods .	73.26354
discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one ' s democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife .	67.2371
( 2 ) realtors realize , of course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing .	56.1152
on the positive side , recent federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position	58.09081
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage .	56.9794
realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for example , in connecticut ' s new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey ' ' , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record .	49.784405
as far as they were aware , the connecticut association of real estate boards had not officially opposed the bill ' s passage or lobbied in its support .	60.957767
( this has not been the case everywhere .	7.2023168
in 1957 , the real estate boards of new york city actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law .	74.271965
official reasoning the bill was a `` wanton invasion of basic property rights ' ' .	13.911273
there are sins of omission as well as commission	44485.05
the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced .	67.912605
judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v . kraemer ( 1948 ) has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible .	17.359167
such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses .	31.234545
in the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of `` social reformism ' ' that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid .	43.851826
but as yet , no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods .	39.86902
one of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work .	66.70314
but responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , american good .	164.60136
such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that embraces scarsdale or yonkers , but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive .	35.674263
that community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment .	49.378063
racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator .	55.173264
thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions .	50.87164
( 3 ) over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .	48.274376
most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as `` professional people ' ' with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions .	45.832478
but what significance attaches to `` professional ' ' , beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client ' s stated needs as already noted ? ?	75.85945
our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .	22.21818
as a theologian in the group pointed out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who `` professed ' ' to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills .	41.22289
if we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization science and religion .	56.28459
science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom .	15.678121
religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .	62.358215
how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ?	77.167854
and yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision .	102.23426
we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .	121.11356
and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith .	24.224651
to see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom .	59.784267
you know that i could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on hiroshima .	26.672834
it was only about the size of a baseball	999.21124
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20 , 000 tons of aj .	27.861704
that is enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire state building	84.314606
and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem .	168.15674
now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world .	22.25127
but we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb .	48.819145
hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .	5.7192545
water is af and the h stands for hydrogen	6.086191
there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies .	17.157564
i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima .	49.591694
i won ' t try the experiment , but i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion .	76.97679
and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond .	91.25028
salt water is still af , the same hydrogen is there .	81.11596
and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today .	61.964825
of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture .	64.59196
for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days .	85.265686
and think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make .	121.6599
with just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years .	60.616665
then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come .	46.166348
it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .	51.02362
now let us see where this power comes from .	403.7244
to grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is .	101.652695
i have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry .	74.32684
one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms	79.427155
and i asked myself a question suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ?	82.70026
i calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body	51.45353
that is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large number .	90.905365
then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator	96.63587
a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic	47.225094
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people	34.72009
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia .	21.282145
i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so i decided to take another measure -- the whole state of pennsylvania .	70.24917
imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas	31.438591
so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep .	35.43482
you can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars	46.193443
pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas .	7.3131466
but we still have a long way to go .	36.205013
next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- north america , south america , europe , asia , and africa , all covered with peas four feet deep	39.444057
next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep	65.68545
finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky way	37.57725
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body .	52.66844
so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .	343.7904
now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it .	95.047035
let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland growing pill .	26.49799
i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me .	60.150223
i shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long .	39.76245
then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside .	57.463276
and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs .	33.145367
these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone .	39.067413
since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom .	32.64418
so you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin .	37.75289
this is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus .	16.042294
even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead .	28.7575
it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits	34.177597
it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy .	13.038062
you may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space .	51.105812
and since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too .	44.80295
if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper .	54.74873
someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .	334.36682
at any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are .	28.426723
now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture .	70.303856
for we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics	8.047973
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine	333.85608
and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts .	15.72775
so if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine	65.46981
and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine .	20.187738
and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom .	42.773426
and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .	54.927746
then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920 ' s .	9.357772
a suggestion from louis de broglie , a physicist in france , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves .	54.81665
and to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .	67.81459
now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it .	43.55128
these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral .	76.397964
and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .	121.889435
it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony .	74.65961
harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there	38075.527
and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe .	31.11126
and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music .	34.470097
the island of nantucket , part of the state of massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state .	25.943384
some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living .	34.86986
the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors	240.24184
during about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers , food , and cars	46.28991
but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to nantucket in the daytime .	88.72006
this is a fine trip , too , on a good day .	52.72342
with martha ' s vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours .	52.062267
to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect the united states of america in the nineteenth century ? ?	18.387133
how far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age ? ?	51.52204
to what extent did it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ? ?	26.976341
a complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the christian faith data are unobtainable .	51.18711
even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of christianity from other factors .	29.213627
although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor .	102.345665
at times we can say that it was the major factor .	19.303255
what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation .	72.42542
as we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches .	62.03359
presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater or lesser extent .	70.401115
many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse .	79.839676
the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock , for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration	39.642147
for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was roman catholicism , and for a small minority it was eastern orthodoxy .	24.103598
upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation .	18.891466
upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was .	118.07194
yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of christianity would be impossible .	82.4378
at best only an approximation could be arrived at .	116.09262
to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .	45.84486
for instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose .	66.179855
the temptation is to say that , as the percentage of church members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level .	45.492786
we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed .	45.36632
thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts .	24.256508
if guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership .	25.099884
as church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude .	15.545123
but whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know .	25.261631
what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation .	74.32762
we have already hinted at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life .	56.497307
we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards , and through leaders in the government .	61.828293
throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock .	29.14164
by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour .	80.01485
in the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration .	24.290028
the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock .	7.271731
thus `` america ' ' , the most widely sung of the patriotic songs , was written by a new england baptist clergyman , samuel francis smith ( 1808-1895 ) , while a student in andover theological seminary .	18.98487
with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the evangelical revivals .	29.729536
the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith .	36.843124
here was what was called the american dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it .	50.286373
later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine lee bates ( 1859-1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of new england congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , written in 1893 , `` america the beautiful ' ' , with the words `` o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness .	42.001274
america , america , god mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , the liberty in law .	54.928715
o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .	19.890377
america , america , god shed his grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea ' ' .	28.550735
the american dream was compounded of many strains .	6.453916
some were clearly of christian origin , among them the great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian liberty , christian equality , and christian fraternity the passion of the land .	33.417477
some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection as the fountain-head of the american hope .	24.090109
here , too , must be placed unitarianism and , less obviously from christian inspiration , emerson , transcendentalism , and the idealism of walt whitman .	14.984127
we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them melville , hawthorne , and henry james the elder , all of them out of a christian background .	32.35807
with such a dream arising , at least in part , from the protestant heritage of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression .	30.15949
a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills .	51.283085
significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements , especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism .	31.112514
several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .	14.075566
quakers , some from new england , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted .	47.92496
we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day saints , the seventh day adventists , christian science , the american board of commissioners for foreign missions , the american home missionary society , the american bible society , and new england theology .	45.34989
the atmosphere was one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills .	39.155724
the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , looked for the early coming of the millennium , and was paralleled by the confidence in man ' s ability cherished by the unitarians , emerson , and the transcendentalists .	34.360447
we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles and the pietism of the continent of europe -- among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the inner mission , and the red cross .	24.542658
we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .	52.867573
a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .	87.14926
several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century .	38.4918
some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .	5.000732
still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age .	101.1274
the movement to end negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until , as a result of the civil war , emancipation was achieved .	29.408493
long before 1815 the christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly .	117.15628
for example , in 1693 the philadelphia yearly meeting of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .	71.03547
in the latter year samuel hopkins , from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology took its name , asked the continental congress to abolish slavery .	50.899784
as we have seen , methodism early took a stand against slavery .	20.260767
beginning at least as far back as 1789 various baptist bodies condemned slavery .	152.19879
after 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock .	58.436638
the nineteenth-century immigration , whether protestant or roman catholic , was not so much concerned , for very few if any among them held slaves they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves .	60.907127
benjamin lundy ( 1789-1839 ) , a quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies .	34.800617
it was he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject .	66.11226
garrison , massachusetts born of nova scotian parentage , was by temperament and conviction a reformer .	20.146158
chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of `` immediate and unconditional abolition ' ' , he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women ' s rights , prohibition , and justice to the indians .	37.290073
incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout baptist , in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john greenleaf whittier ( 1807-1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible .	26.813152
a marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals .	10.202826
finney himself , while opposed to slavery , placed his chief emphasis on evangelism , but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign .	92.669014
theodore dwight weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active .	98.98783
weld was the son and grandson of new england congregational ministers .	3.0561748
as a youth he became one of finney ' s band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .	27.868612
a strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , charles stewart , another finney convert , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause .	31.863245
a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position .	59.093933
the majority then went to the infant oberlin .	3.9591346
they and others employed some of finney ' s techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause .	34.76687
weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as joshua r . giddings and edwin m . stanton , enlisted john quincy adams , and helped provide ideas which underlay harriet beecher stowe ' s uncle tom ' s cabin .	25.23566
he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame .	111.72113
wendell phillips ( 1811-1884 ) , from a prominent massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher .	50.824066
although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils , he remained a devout christian .	28.039337
he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition .	54.903343
the anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by arthur tappan ( 1786-1865 ) and his younger brother , lewis tappan ( 1788-1873 ) .	18.268274
individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits	44.465824
they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities .	18.976204
their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe .	21.418688
royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .	48.8922
thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors .	83.253586
but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .	12.9042425
since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living .	28.986187
the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .	72.18006
proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world	61.127144
but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom .	57.781586
this is the familiar system of `` cosmic government ' ' .	20.552809
the chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers .	9.635938
he regulated the dualities of light and darkness , yang and yin , which are locked in eternal struggle .	24.94986
by swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons .	10.687061
his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions .	51.522602
in this system , no man is exempt from obligations .	75.46795
failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one ' s family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead .	65.84001
and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters .	6.7216096
the family home was , in fact , a temple	58.408253
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature .	154.42273
the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear .	283.25998
the common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything .	181.99982
the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control .	52.726044
men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code .	32.448734
if the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine .	20.483643
modern westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection .	49.48812
living in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings , but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes .	39.03693
basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns .	31.955612
in china , the magical system par excellence was taoism .	9.068865
the taoists were quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the tao -- underlying all phenomena .	15.530717
it was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .	34.747417
the taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation	22.982164
in other words , they were actually an organization of magicians .	20.161179
mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts .	14.031175
after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced into china , it underwent extensive changes .	30.991846
during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader .	32.843544
mahayana had gods , and magic , a pantheon , heavens and hells , and gorgeously appareled priests , monks , and nuns , all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world .	16.740559
the self-realized mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .	17.346922
the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic , that made the world into a huge magical garden .	71.061386
in its monastic form , mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes ) , who catered to the chinese faith in the supernatural .	20.947525
nonmagical confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government .	55.293392
confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .	168.27658
if a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him .	143.83037
but let us not be mistaken about confucian `` virtue ' '	16.299057
this was not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation .	33.111576
to the confucian , `` virtue ' ' simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones .	93.97832
propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman .	91.57065
to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man ' s fate .	69.627884
this , in brief , was the historical background out of which zen emerged .	242.09386
promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry , and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism .	18.453142
but the `` marvelous person ' ' that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality than indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls .	54.347885
proponents of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism in zen , probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic .	17.949429
but in the chinese mind , there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be .	37.78427
actually , zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism .	11.875279
the ch ' an ( zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from mahayana , but its psychology was pure early taoist .	49.039146
this is well evidenced by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen the idea of the inward turning of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity , peace , and stillness -- a union with the infinite , with the tao -- could be effected .	56.313744
in fact , the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the `` direct thinking ' ' zennist was a feature of taoism .	28.393728
so , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .	87.30848
zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .	43.334663
one of its features attractive to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts .	26.188854
one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse .	24.63065
but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistakes it .	46.159313
it is simply that in taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books , words , or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience .	60.77237
the truth -- the eternal truth -- is not transmittable by words .	11.621225
reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap .	62.922115
the technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind ' s grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century b . c . chinese quietism the koan is not basically a new device .	42.366074
it is important for an understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man .	24.662523
in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers .	157.91139
and this is only natural -- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest `` wonder drug ' ' .	51.10207
early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine , personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence .	40.304867
but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers .	82.59365
the anchorite strove , in fact , to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power .	26.720463
thus , the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation .	39.883717
as the zen literature reveals , as soon as an early zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers .	43.43751
the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles .	14.886477
exponents of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of china , and proposed instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe .	61.08638
in support of this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power .	50.027485
but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess , as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity `` hwang pah ( o baku ) , one day going up mount tien tai which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light .	35.07501
they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent .	44.77858
there being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore	35.55994
but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow him .	15.028079
thereupon hwang pah said `` if i knew thou art an arhat , i would have doubled you up before thou got over there ' ' ! !	73.80056
the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah , and praised him as a true mahayanist .	16.413137
a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess `` on one occasion yang shan ( kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air .	57.261032
when that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation , he asked `` where art thou from ' ' ? ?	16.886332
`` early this morning ' ' , replied the other , `` i set out from india ' ' .	32.929214
`` why ' ' , said the teacher , `` art thou so late ' ' ? ?	23.835873
`` i stopped ' ' , responded the man , `` several times to look at beautiful sceneries ' ' .	29.692213
`` thou mayst have supernatural powers ' ' , exclaimed yang shan , `` yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me ' ' .	19.158777
then the monk praised yang shan saying `` i have come over to china in order to worship manjucri , and met unexpectedly with minor shakya ' ' , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india , went back through the air .	81.37553
in the popular chinese mind , ch ' an ( zen ) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated .	66.04537
a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes .	38.301342
to the zen monk the universe is still populated with `` spiritual beings ' ' who have to be appeased .	11.476327
part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings ' ' .	21.209938
modern zen presentation to the west insists on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire , action is based on direct self-confidence , and so on .	59.546394
this picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such zendo formulas as `` o you , demons and other spiritual beings , i now offer this to you , and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith .	44.55779
pope leo 13 , on the 13th day of december 1898 , granted the following indulgences `` an indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the faithful who read the holy gospels at least a quarter of an hour .	32.962395
a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading ' ' .	69.03439
pope pius the sixth , at rome , in april , 1778 , wrote the following `` the faithful should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times ' ' .	40.413067
the american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore urged the catholic people to read the holy bible .	44.08535
`` we hope ' ' , they said , `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the holy scriptures ' ' .	27.117765
they recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures ' ' .	60.749424
since the catholic church expresses such desire that the sacred scriptures be read , the following taken from the holy bible ( new catholic edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing .	55.881023
do not wonder that i said to thee , `` you must be born again ' ' .	8.6182785
the new birth is necessary because god is holy .	13.0687895
but as the one who called you is holy , be you also holy in all your behavior	195.48788
for it is written , you shall be holy , because i am holy .	21.13936
1 , st . peter 15 , 16 .	4.3316803
holiness without which no man will see god .	9.234682
the new birth is necessary because all have sinned .	1.6815637
as it is written , there is not one just man	1162.4008
all have sinned and have need of the glory of god .	8.016592
the new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind .	30.300203
therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death , and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned .	75.362114
you also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins .	20.543667
and if our gospel also is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing .	22.207144
in their case , the god of this world ( satan ) has blinded their unbelieving minds , that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ , who is the image of god .	17.499529
for his workmanship we are , created in christ jesus .	39.809162
the new birth is effected through the word of god	4.5236635
for you have been reborn , not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible , through the word of god .	36.13935
of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth .	21.839123
amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again of water ( symbol of the word of god , see ephesians 26 ) and the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .	41.776825
that which is born of the flesh is flesh	5.4083347
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .	16.275023
if we are born of god we have faith in christ as the only saviour .	28.586052
everyone who believes that jesus is the christ is born of god .	14.536694
as many as received him were born of god .	9.042911
if we are born of god we do not practice sin as a habit .	55.345566
whoever is born of god does not commit sin ( that is , he does not practice sin .	29.52087
cf . 1 st . john 2 1 ) .	18.851292
we know that no one who is born of god commits sin .	15.6611595
( the new nature , received at the time of regeneration , is divine and holy , and as the believer lives under the power of this new nature he does not practice sin .	44.16045
) if we are born of god we practice righteousness .	84.37851
if you know that he ( god ) is just ( righteous ) , know that everyone also who does what is just ( righteous ) has been born of him .	89.34668
if we are born of god we love god .	8.556593
everyone who loves is born of god , and knows god .	141.04904
if we are born of god we love the brethren .	6.3453755
we know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren .	29.158945
he who does not love abides in death .	2.8285284
if we are born of god we overcome the world .	18.363787
all that is born of god overcomes the world	35.202267
and this is the victory that overcomes the world , our faith .	43.33672
if we are born of god we grow in ( not into , but in ) grace .	199.20822
but grow in grace and knowledge of our lord and savior , jesus christ .	5.7747684
if we are born of god we persevere unto the end .	72.302315
i am convinced of this , that he who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of christ jesus .	102.03444
now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to set you before the presence of his glory , without blemish , in gladness , to the only god our savior , through jesus christ our lord , belong glory and majesty , dominion and authority , before all time , and now , and forever .	53.978764
the new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature .	33.625854
jesus answered and said to him ( nicodemus ) `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god ' ' .	10.312646
`` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again of water and the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .	22.064787
that which is born of the flesh is flesh	5.4083347
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .	16.275023
do not wonder that i said to thee , ' you must be born again ' ' ' .	36.941795
for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account .	119.86362
if then any man is in christ , he is a new creature ( literally , `` he is a new creation ) , the former things have passed away	57.393143
for by grace you have been saved through faith	1168.1707
and that not from yourselves , for it is the gift of god	7.1099024
not as the outcome of works , lest anyone may boast .	141.00157
for his workmanship we are , created in christ jesus .	39.809162
the new birth is the implantation of a new life .	17.903584
he who has the son has the life .	96.1631
he who has not the son has not the life .	74.84866
he who believes in the son ( jesus christ , the son of god ) , has everlasting life .	7.974218
the new birth is the impartation of the divine nature .	28.335062
through which he has granted us the very great and precious promises , so that through them you may become partaker of the divine nature .	51.42688
the new birth is christ living in you by faith .	149.66158
christ in you , your hope of glory .	7.923812
it is now no longer i that live , but christ lives in me .	158.0265
and the life that i now live in the flesh , i live in the faith of the son of god , who loved me and gave himself up for me .	34.140396
to have christ dwelling through faith in your hearts .	8.766584
the wind blows where it will , and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes .	121.80258
so is everyone who is born of the spirit .	22.535734
amen , amen , i say to you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has life everlasting , and does not come to judgment , but has passed from death to life .	80.95476
the new birth is a work of god .	5.055689
but to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of god	47.70159
to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of god .	92.70079
you may be very religious , a good church member , an upright , honest and sincere person	31.186304
you may be baptized , confirmed , reverent and worshipful	3.979558
you may attend mass , do penance , say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church	22.198992
you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment .	58.553875
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again .	8.489048
our blessed lord jesus christ , the sinless son of god , who could not lie , said , `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god ' ' ( st . john 3 3 ) .	13.546542
`` you must be born again ' ' ( st . john 3 7 ) .	9.383435
being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting christ as saviour , and being convicted by the holy spirit of my lost condition , i do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works , and just now receive jesus as my personal saviour and salvation as a free gift from him .	61.60819
you may do as you please with god now .	59.78484
god placed himself in men ' s hands when he sent jesus christ into the world as perfect god and perfect man in one being .	66.20681
he was then in man ' s hands .	2.7672853
finally men arrested him , gave him a mock trial , flogged him , nailed him on a cross and hung him between earth and heaven	28.008415
you can do likewise though christ is not bodily present .	262.13388
you can ignore his book , the bible , and his church .	32.56095
you can laugh at his blood-bought salvation , curse his followers , and laugh at hell .	34.037872
the eternal christ may knock at your soul ' s door , calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven .	74.41045
you may refuse him , spit on him , call him a devil , curse him .	29.362932
you may take his name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose .	52.84485
on the other hand , you may seek his favor , humble yourself before him and beg his mercy , implore his forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to him .	24.7676
he has said , `` behold , i stand at the door , and knock if any man hear my voice , and open the door , i will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me ' ' ( revelation 3 20	56.941673
the latch is on your side of the door .	28.09905
the choice is yours the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with god	118.53271
the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of holy spirit discipline .	120.0802
the choice is yours god is in your hands , now .	54.68322
god has already set the day when you will be in his hands .	50.93623
what he does with you then depends on what you do with him now .	44.703278
then it will be a `` fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god ' ' if you have abused him in your hands .	43.388916
this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary .	6.9312787
when i came into being , 15 years ago , i had one primary purpose to help men and women everywhere to know god better , and through knowing him better to become happier and more effective people .	72.71111
when you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts .	42.45394
some of the people who speak through my pages are famous	169.24796
some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .	160.57928
some are so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of god , that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known , and will never see .	37.807728
fifteen years ago , there were no guideposts at all .	35.241814
this month a million guideposts will circulate all over the world .	32.918514
experts in the publishing field consider this astounding .	7.898637
they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following .	110.443756
to me , the explanation is very simple .	4.7748857
i am not doing anything , of myself .	15.811265
it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness , even when they turn away from it .	82.44055
it is the power that holds the stars in their orbits , but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass .	38.62353
it is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is .	104.436386
it is mankind ' s wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace .	21.177982
all things are possible to god , but he chooses -- usually -- to work through people .	134.83249
sometimes such people sense that they are being used	35.491333
fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women , regardless of creed or color , could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living .	40.455013
neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea .	63.44949
they borrowed a typewriter , raised about $2 , 000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called guideposts .	82.83238
compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed .	209.616
but from the start they had two important ingredients sincerity and realism .	36.798466
the people who told the stories were sincere .	4.7598495
for example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of new york ' s down-and-outers , he didn ' t just ask questions .	71.47782
len lesourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days .	17.659826
many of you are familiar , i ' m sure , with the story of my early struggles the fire in january , 1947 , that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers .	83.773506
the help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere .	121.22738
the crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me .	15.571627
that was when a remarkable woman , teresa durlach , came to my aid -- not so much with money , as with wisdom and courage .	62.081142
`` you ' re not living up to your own principles ' ' , she told my discouraged people .	53.233597
`` you ' re so preoccupied that you ' ve let your faith grow dim .	54.39223
what do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers ? ?	8.094282
visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them ' ' ! !	22.440466
and the 100 , 000 subscribers became a reality .	114.75925
and now a million january guideposts are in circulation .	13.534446
with our growth came expansion into new fields of service .	42.670906
today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .	19.832365
they say all personnel have spiritual needs which guideposts helps to meet .	63.89892
hundreds of civic clubs , business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land .	265.37042
they say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built .	118.32286
thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the armed forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere .	26.100445
bedridden people say i am easy to hold -- and read .	191.82495
three years ago it became possible to finance a braille edition for blind readers .	60.456806
throughout these exciting years i have been fortunate for , although i have never offered great financial inducements , talent has found its way to me william boal who so ably organizes business operations	94.986725
irving granville and nelson rector who travel widely calling on business firms .	84.20475
searching for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not only the country , but the whole world .	66.1803
glenn kittler has been twice to africa , once spending a week with dr . albert schweitzer .	51.303303
last summer john and elizabeth sherrill were in alaska .	9.493098
twice a month the editorial staff meets in new york for an early supper , then a long evening of idea-exchange .	31.883392
around the table sit protestant , catholic , and jew .	30.065762
each contributes something different , and something important ruth peale , her wide experience in church work	227.28163
sidney fields , years of experience as a new york columnist	35.911575
catherine marshall lesourd , the insight that has made her books world-famous and norm mullendore , the keen perception of an advertising executive .	76.80147
there are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence .	143.99274
elaine st . johns may fly in from the west coast for the editorial staff meetings .	35.032154
starr jones gets up every morning at five o ' clock , milks his family cow , attends to farm chores , and then takes a two-hour train trip to new york .	17.822712
arthur gordon comes once a month all the way from georgia .	157.45673
we have also seen the power of faith at work among us .	224.79605
rose weiss , who handles all the prayer-requests that we receive , answering each letter personally , has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering she has had many major operations , and now gets about in a limited way on braces and crutches .	92.89234
recently , john sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer .	23.058846
we prayed for john , during surgery , we asked others to pray	101.859
all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him .	87.09608
perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all .	91.946106
but , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it .	111.22556
that is the kind of people they are .	213.54218
perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ? ?	30.459053
serious , yes , but also much laughter .	22.029867
sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate .	26.932865
there are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the most helpful idea .	67.087036
and there is also something intangible that hovers around the table .	24.049685
each meeting starts with a prayer , offered spontaneously by one member of the group .	24.83181
it takes many forms , this prayer , but in essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help guideposts ' readers .	44.29499
for you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is guideposts .	26.019855
i need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers .	17.326714
my message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in god .	61.89599
havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men ' s eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices .	22.826519
rumors flew from lip to lip that fidel castro was on his way to havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought batista for five years .	24.658232
already the city was filled with barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the prado .	15.27512
and then castro himself did come , bearded , smiling	3.614294
yet if you looked closely you ' d see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .	35.069588
at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man .	128.93407
i am sure that castro was happy , too , about that support .	102.05497
diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper in cuba , with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny .	127.42263
my grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials .	6.1112127
my own earliest memories are of exiles my three brothers and i were taken often to the united states `` to visit relatives ' ' while my father stayed on to fight the dictator machado .	58.139027
when it was my turn , i , too , printed the truth as i knew it about batista , and rejoiced to see his regime topple .	44.16995
none of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead .	34.015083
i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana .	53.092216
within a week , however , i began to suspect that something was wrong .	64.009705
for castro was bringing cuba not freedom , but hatred .	63.104015
he spent long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge .	54.64055
he showed us how he dealt with his enemies he executed them before tv cameras .	103.8354
on home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon , the firing wall .	29.982475
he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance .	5.2370954
new schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation any academic degree earned during batista ' s regime was invalid .	124.72886
he had promised cheaper housing arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room .	41.13903
under another law , hundreds of farms were seized .	24.301872
farm workers had their wages cut almost in half .	22.07621
of this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in script usable only in `` people ' s stores ' ' .	45.221107
a suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist .	35.517082
in my mind , i began to review his use of hate to gain support	162.28787
his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain .	91.21726
but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace	87.03115
what should i do about it , i asked myself ? ?	33.641163
i had watched castro handling his enemies before the paredon .	3.7441518
there was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him , mobs would appear outside our windows shouting `` paredon ! !	65.626526
i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario now the rotogravures , gleaming behind glass doors	45.294785
the thump and whir of our new presses .	2.0332353
here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if i told it to .	106.59208
then one day , early in january , 1960 , i sat down at my desk , and suddenly i was aware of the crucifix .	33.173183
it was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me .	11.893735
i had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner .	66.230995
now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with sadness in his eyes , saying	51.739983
but do you have any choice ' ' ? ?	2.998845
i knew in that moment that i did not have any choice .	25.999924
from that day on i began to write editorials about the things i did not think correct in fidel castro ' s regime .	50.10927
too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don ' t want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things ' ' because `` you ' ll stunt your growth ' ' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` hey lookit mr . america	33.356827
whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) ' ' ? ?	56.334663
after all , a guy ' s gotta have a little ego ! !	51.054317
therefore it ' s a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! !	65.35066
this happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new junior mr . canada -- henri de courcy .	49.137833
far from discouraging henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments .	168.30963
instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority , professor roland claude .	96.21168
and they couldn ' t have entrusted henri to better hands because `` le professeur ' ' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth .	48.607197
that ' s because the good professor teaches only weider methods at his famous montreal health studio which is located at 1821 mt . royal east in montreal .	58.287365
undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) .	76.48924
there ' s gaetan d ' amours who is our newest mr . canada	191.56845
jean-paul senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago	39.08753
jack boissoneault , who was with us last month	2.9341614
charles harve , who recently won the `` most muscular man ' ' subdivision award in the mr . canada event	57.23095
yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! !	1.1703581
now when henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 ' ' ' ' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .	51.940136
about that time he began reading mr . america and muscle builder and he learned of the famous weider way to fast weight gaining .	176.47322
seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of quick-wate and super-protein , those two wonder-working weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .	25.718706
well , sir they did real great ! !	1.5896584
for in almost less time than it takes to tell it , henri ' s bodyweight was increasing rapidly .	37.62898
he ' s crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame .	50.450138
henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn ' t have to work them very much .	36.094833
but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body .	16.781483
it was muscular but it wasn ' t symmetrical .	41.102333
`` a real ' nothing ' torso ' ' , says henri .	8.886696
it just got longer and longer ' ' .	1.2459986
that ' s when he went to professor claude .	544.2304
and at once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it .	70.12169
in his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked out ' ' equipment since vic tanny .	30.403788
mr . claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous weider push-pull super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set is a pressing or `` pushing ' ' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling ' ' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group .	31.25282
so right away claude introduced henri to his famous `` moon ' ' bench and proceeded to teach him his first push-pull super-set consisting of the wide-grip straight-arm pullover ( the `` pull ' ' part of the push-pull super-set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar bench press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , reeves-type `` gladiator ' ' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids .	24.268864
as you can see , in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! !	60.6058
now when henri has completed four complete push-pull super-sets no . 1 , the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete push-pull super-sets no . 2 .	63.96107
super-set no . 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon ' ' and flat benches .	52.183994
the `` push ' ' exercise of this push-pull super-set is the bench press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation .	34.366966
you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .	48.241447
the dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the aj .	6.148286
the `` pull ' ' exercise in this super-set is the one-dumbbell bent-arm pullover .	7.0445166
( note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) .	44.549694
in the third push-pull super-set the `` push ' ' exercise is the widegrip pushup between bars , while the `` pull ' ' exercise is the moon bench lateral raise with bent arms .	27.334602
the pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ! !	48.118156
this is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved .	46.770115
you ' ll know when you ' ve made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ! !	45.684063
as you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip .	18.23508
he just can ' t do anything about it at all ! !	58.40352
but as you can also see , it ' s not a painful exercise at all , because henri de courcy -- the `` happy ' ' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! !	41.09383
the last exercise of roland claude ' s prescribed program for henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets .	169.70924
by this time henri ' s entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work .	67.12713
he has henri do from four to six sets of the incline bench press ( note the high incline ) .	19.964788
this gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and aj .	28.954773
this is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests	27.91224
that steel-edged `` carved-out-of-solid rock ' ' looks of the great champions .	19.747746
so with four complete push-pull super-sets no . 1 , four of no . 2 , four of no . 3 and four to six sets of the incline bench press , you can see that henri de courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon .	28.37323
physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone .	133.47908
rarer still is a mr . america or mr . universe of true herculean build .	61.05607
the aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles .	71.699844
now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts .	12.459521
but contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor ' s chisel -- is something quite different .	56.450294
this comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .	94.77512
often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others .	56.07518
because they are `` minority ' ' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten .	75.55797
only when the newest mr . america or mr . universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are .	89.07698
the exercise i shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the one leg lunge .	42.95751
why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! !	164.75151
it is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders	41.653904
a criterion of muscle `` drama ' ' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike	59.59849
the facet of muscular development that wins prizes .	27.592716
definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship olympic lifters which is easily understandable .	28.704502
the one leg lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts .	103.16165
but for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular squatting , leg curling , leg extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed .	31.058931
indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed .	82.32639
used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ! !	52.759834
really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective 1 .	74.4303
it ' s a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise .	2.8572378
it places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition .	57.088646
it improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make squats more easily and more correctly performed .	47.484783
it speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused on each .	82.74652
you ' ll need your weider power stands for this fine exercise and here ' s the way it ' s done 1 .	58.701393
place your power stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean .	42.37963
grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck )	34.5033
extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split .	37.779804
now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet .	54.07725
when the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the power stands .	90.19505
after you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner .	32.089
that ' s the one-leg lunge in a nutshell .	1.8839433
you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety .	130.42447
you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise .	33.261055
oh , you ' ll wobble and weave quite a bit at first .	33.264378
before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you ' ll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ! !	55.7133
although i suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there ' s no reason why you shouldn ' t make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .	20.161491
squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front .	115.42335
the most beautiful bed of pansies i ' ve seen was in a south dakota yard on a sizzling day .	43.37516
pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun .	74.72892
i sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather .	37.738327
`` i just love them ' ' , he said .	3.2711887
the more i talked with him , the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming .	44.04673
of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .	15.516616
he planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist .	6.4288545
these specialists , i learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers .	57.172935
their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains .	17.574398
i asked him if he took seeds from his own plants .	19.90513
occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did	72.39919
but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down ' ' .	71.95127
it ' s best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .	35.407227
his soil was `` nothing special ' ' , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown-black .	27.965864
i fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body .	35.780296
it isn ' t easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil .	66.75946
nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .	4.962355
they germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily .	32.64386
it doesn ' t really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours .	49.838
i like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames .	90.490135
they ' d rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days .	43.138515
if you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .	44.333206
for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting .	35.19942
i dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .	36.527046
then i cover the sowing with a board .	21.500406
this keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds .	78.79052
ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .	37.147625
when the first sprinkling of green appears i remove the board .	20.871506
a light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth .	100.29565
i like sawdust for this , or hay .	48.995464
when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it ' s time to set them out where they are to remain .	45.76927
every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .	76.85308
the moral is don ' t transplant it any oftener than you must .	107.1055
as soon as they are large enough to move , i put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom .	120.02615
i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant .	172.42197
that encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers .	66.92281
i doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .	21.211582
lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine .	77.41349
one year i simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a little sand had been added , and i had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors ' experience .	45.41868
in addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea .	71.21352
as a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .	44.32785
three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool .	22.785458
when winter comes be ready with additional mulch .	9.171804
i like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost .	103.90153
that keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing .	7.508921
don ' t miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter .	29.473583
whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days , you ' ll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two .	34.073383
if those aren ' t enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? ?	114.637184
the pansies i cherished most bloomed for me in february during a particularly cold winter .	100.54685
i started the seed in a flat in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .	77.32223
( an unheated greenhouse would have been better , if i had had one .	68.72588
) the plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them .	32.546585
in response to the lengthening days of february they budded , then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers .	20.375025
its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it .	211.83159
like strawberries in december , pansies are far more exciting in february than in may .	113.62987
try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can ' t take another day of it .	56.364407
the day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy ' ' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .	19.714798
try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there .	48.58257
pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season .	36.305767
as soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant .	234.8712
a second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch .	86.225624
these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring .	180.90082
i like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming .	70.0451
probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed .	60.717884
nature ' s aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation .	37.002724
that done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .	185.07503
here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds .	39.860237
go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist .	1.909367
it is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things	107.94409
but you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow .	64.559044
many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over .	101.47307
if the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first .	35.469116
would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? ?	1.0275759
remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds .	65.732635
they stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it .	62.94138
treat them right and they ' ll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones .	77.58201
give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they ' ll repay your solicitude with beauty .	42.369316
a salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .	68.2228
this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the united states .	44.67544
it has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven ' t made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should .	74.40116
you will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .	61.61283
it is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe bartlett pear , but oily .	27.718609
the avocado should have a `` give ' ' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe .	31.112589
the flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange	52.43557
it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like .	5.2320266
it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits .	56.81149
sometimes it takes several `` eatings ' ' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world .	117.82936
once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation .	78.62737
today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world .	52.08093
the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point .	27.734812
it is brought to packing houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior .	38.831356
the fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-f . , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state .	66.97619
this cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored .	51.697
this happens on the grocer ' s shelf or in your kitchen .	34.99103
one of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .	30.446346
there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .	136.37665
if the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed .	62.132523
and unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado .	15.057352
it is thick , much like an egg plant ' s skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer .	65.88567
good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited .	50.072437
avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients .	2.4620368
their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system .	14.303059
aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins a and c -- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin e requirement .	38.76777
the b vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin .	2.226679
calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts .	55.32227
none of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage .	15.189815
dr . wilson c . grant , of the veterans ' administration hospital , coral gables , florida , and the university of miami school of medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients .	32.2065
the study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 .	81.86888
they were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood .	41.51323
then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption .	22.677137
five , four , three , two , one , fire ! !	82.18746
the tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .	128.61966
the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach .	10.49742
never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear .	57.99836
nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying .	11.462674
a great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets .	113.186104
it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent ' s cities and people .	64.288246
with a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim ' s people ? ?	30.074415
wouldn ' t the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ?	109.38114
the will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken .	51.212646
nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days	473.3395
and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes .	43.01889
at this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , being `` soft ' ' , and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons .	46.54997
however , because this vulnerability is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent ' s cities , at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal .	47.828064
it should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic .	21.84577
icbms have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways .	19.22091
they could be used to attack a nation ' s people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker ' s own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy ' s military force .	28.257507
if our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles .	46.31267
we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves .	117.5666
we must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile .	91.27048
missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations .	122.5865
because of a missile ' s ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately .	32.005142
placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons .	50.952007
one must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing .	37.74622
even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously , the icbm still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes .	22.781176
therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered .	49.618473
because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability .	42.71373
in order to destroy the enemy ' s mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles .	18.605173
until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us .	19.079962
it seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other ' s citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us .	38.340435
let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm force .	16.20925
it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the b-52 or b-70 in hunter-killer operations against soviet railway-based missiles .	28.72415
if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons .	45.154667
an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of russia -- provided that we had used some of our icbms to degrade russia ' s air defenses before our bombers got there .	65.03951
the aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile .	37.689495
why , then , aren ' t we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? ?	63.33502
is there any other way to do the job ? ?	13.460297
survivability of our strategic forces ( polaris , mobile and hardened minuteman , hardened atlas and titan , and airborne skybolt ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force .	24.727541
war , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation .	61.93481
forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict .	73.62833
the forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed .	20.538452
even mobile forces must be found and destroyed .	3.3223495
but , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ?	79.35126
they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile .	24.436485
some day , many years in the future , true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets .	14.105273
but until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft .	21.260738
however , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , `` soft ' ' airfields .	38.058147
here then is our problem aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing	126.16742
but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile .	19.45854
this makes today ' s aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon .	44.392647
aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once .	149.41628
this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile .	47.819374
but remember this -- it isn ' t the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield .	53.449615
eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles .	45.487495
there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground	15.872323
put aircraft in `` bomb-proof ' ' hangars when they are on the ground .	29.48234
build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3 , 000-foot ) airfields with runways .	57.56694
if we could use all the small airfields we have in this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more .	43.62408
use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life .	40.730324
using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( vtol ) long-range military aircraft .	21.097147
we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 aj .	32.02346
we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters .	18.808784
large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3 , 000-foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today .	30.004414
there is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile .	36.486965
this same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft .	22.81641
one seldom hears the analogy `` nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine ' ' .	26.908598
if , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one .	40.102356
with powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built .	21.621193
for example , a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter .	5.751444
with a 15-to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weighing 300 , 000 pounds could rise vertically .	93.15862
the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don ' t spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete .	46.96769
when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields , they are no longer vulnerable to aj .	13.967205
if our sac bombers were , today , capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance .	73.5005
we would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy ' s force -- whether it were fixed or mobile .	28.348495
with such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating .	35.668335
no need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy ' s military force .	26.69698
our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance .	34.356052
in a few years we will have samos ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) .	18.73135
but in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them ? ?	71.05485
what targets have we successfully knocked out ? ?	1.0051217
a ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful .	80.16535
what targets still remain to be hit ? ?	1.0050193
these crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance .	2.1211672
samos will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark .	33.99838
even if this is some day possible , there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target .	39.850105
if the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced .	49.58337
pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably .	37.79567
it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance .	32.941086
it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night .	23.875475
it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the united states with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone .	78.49903
a large aircraft , such as the b-52 or b-70 , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons .	73.10256
few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1 , 000 psi overpressure at 100 feet .	38.395405
or put another way , the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1/20th the size of those used in hiroshima and nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ! !	46.460537
it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons .	62.795536
today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc . .	48.321934
with these keen `` eyes ' ' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas .	127.55278
if we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy ' s military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening .	40.0155
the lyric beauties of schubert ' s trout quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners .	47.214893
but for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems .	38.093685
since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic .	46.125355
moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor .	24.129684
the many and frequent performances of the trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .	57.399464
some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein .	22.950674
other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation .	30.107998
in these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown ' s attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop .	43.552795
recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer than ten different performances .	55.158665
the occasion for this marathon angel ' s long-awaited reissue in its `` great recordings of the century ' ' series of the schnabel-pro arte version .	16.207333
let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first .	54.508198
whether considered alone or in relation to other editions , colh 40 is a document of prime importance .	61.63507
artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert-beethoven-mozart players of all time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .	61.787884
but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to are by schnabel pupils ( clifford curzon , frank glazer , adrian aeschbacher , and victor babin ) also sheds light on the master ' s pedagogical skills .	27.363886
certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` schnabel trill ' ' ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .	36.272614
but the most impressive testimony to schnabel ' s distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student ' s approach as distinctly his own .	48.00464
schnabel ' s emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one .	29.86832
yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .	67.6916
this is a serious-minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .	9.538139
and although schnabel ' s pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to schubert ' s dynamic markings and phrase indications .	13.721834
the piano performance on this trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives .	144.97081
about the pro arte ' s contribution i am less happy .	28.728567
i , for one , rather regret that schnabel didn ' t collaborate with the budapest quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist ' s interpretative outlook than the style of the belgian group .	31.114643
from a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the pro arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .	40.376507
the violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .	11.853937
the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet .	52.94256
there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` forellen ' ' movement , and i suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original aj .	19.069075
turning to the more modern versions , curzon ' s ( london ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .	18.11491
every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these i would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .	62.235386
some of curzon ' s playing strikes me as finicky , however .	16.487906
why , for example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? ?	42.653667
the assisting musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .	34.312996
( special compliments to the double bass playing of johann krumpp his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance .	24.217953
the glazer-fine arts edition ( concert-disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .	25.515308
it is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort .	282.07993
but having lived with the disc for some time now , i find the performance less exciting than either schnabel ' s or fleisher ' s ( whose superb performance with the budapest quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon ' s .	59.281418
aeschbacher ' s work is very much akin to schnabel ' s , but the sound on his decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it .	41.82178
the hephzibah menuhin-amadeus quartet ( angel ) and victor babin-festival quartet ( rca victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing .	10.485764
( babin has acquired some of schnabel ' s keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight .	58.176075
) badura-skoda-vienna konzerthaus ( westminster ) and demus-schubert quartet ( deutsche grammophon ) are both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless .	9.055413
helmut roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists .	30.800783
telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $2 . 98 ) is worthy of consideration .	28.522457
returning once again to the schnabel reissue , i am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist ' s musical penetration .	8.845494
here is truly a `` great recording of the century ' ' , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect .	14.664965
this recording surely belongs in everyone ' s collection .	89.124565
from the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation .	63.154526
seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones .	25.907476
although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .	73.154274
on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of parsifal under karl muck ' s baton , or sense the type of ensemble toscanini created in his years with the new york philharmonic .	47.738636
since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .	93.60394
in many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer .	40.734295
other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics .	57.730667
if we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing .	50.329544
records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music .	97.9846
this difference is made up of many factors .	7.2656975
some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .	44.800854
( music often sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat .	40.288177
) from the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original .	55.953976
any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .	61.93989
yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .	81.31389
but if you know the real thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation .	60.144657
command ' s new brahms second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .	58.819576
like the recent scheherazade from london ( high fidelity , sept . 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects .	46.06593
because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph .	36.95785
the easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values .	48.725628
the engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .	11.783282
the effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .	124.64182
this absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .	44.142628
a contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .	231.11433
the orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing .	37.558163
yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .	41.033024
command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .	8.456466
the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority	39.395428
yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer .	2.9617748
the timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .	17.792734
all of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction .	89.583534
for me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors .	25.871159
steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what brahms set down on paper .	64.52605
those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .	68.49288
without losing the distinctive undertow of brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect .	71.44637
the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real allegro con spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet .	27.253422
in the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings .	88.315575
steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .	50.914455
the engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result .	49.351784
too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment .	17.841219
the command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .	16.006165
your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .	94.93628
it is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener .	95.40043
the first substantially complete stereo giselle ( and the only one of its scope since feyer ' s four-sided lp edition of 1958 for angel ) , this set is , i ' m afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment .	24.523853
the already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in fistoulari ' s melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality .	21.206287
and in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super-high fidelity ' ' .	19.170292
the home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .	116.69681
as with the penultimate giselle release ( wolff ' s abridgment for rca victor ) i find the cleaner , less razor-edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my sd copies .	18.14526
at the westminster kc dog show in madison square garden , new york on the second day , the finals of the junior class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class .	31.275017
the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far south as kentucky .	65.995125
this year several entries from canada were entered which made the junior class international .	232.6284
forty-six of the 53 juniors who mailed in entries were present .	108.937775
it was interesting to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class .	34.801373
as has been the custom for the past several years , john cross , jr . , bench show chmn . of westminster , arranged for the juniors ' meeting before the class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them .	64.4108
over 60 juniors , parents and guests attended .	45.494347
mrs . william h . long , jr . speaks	11.894656
after the juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the finals of the junior class , mrs . william h . long , jr . was introduced as the first speaker .	16.895424
in her opening remarks mrs . long also welcomed the juniors and stated , `` there isn ' t any other show quite like westminster .	47.11621
i know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break .	121.52244
mrs . long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years .	140.0928
twenty years ago her daughter betsey long , then 13 years of age , won the grand challenge trophy , children ' s handling class ( as they were called then ) at westminster .	72.16771
no sooner had betsey come out of the ring than mrs . long walked into the working competition with ch . cadet or noranda , another home-bred product , and won ! !	102.42842
speaking from long years of experience , mrs . long advised the juniors `` when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , stop ! !	54.38226
dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ! !	26.23039
when you and your dog step into the junior ring , it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do .	41.957134
if you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ! !	64.13411
he knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the class is conducted , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers ' ' .	67.81064
`` take away your attitude ' ' , said mrs . long , `` and what have you left ? ?	39.217373
either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ! !	106.06044
or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the class , or you are just doing this to please the parents .	79.61408
`` the reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce .	71.793724
aids sounds more like a pony club , or horsemanship classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ! !	100.86604
`` your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs -- voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be	70.95696
legs to produce motion and rate of speed .	3.4349017
without right attitude the other aids just do not work right ' ' .	19.489717
mrs . long wished all the juniors luck in the class and stated , `` have fun ! !	66.45424
and may you all continue to show at westminster in the years to come ' ' ! !	44.181313
the second speaker was harvey barcus , president of the dog writers ass ' n of america .	62.559338
mr . barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for juniors -- with which he is very familiar .	73.13426
last year a boy he knows and helped in journalism won the thoroughbred racing ass ' n scholarship which is worth $10 , 000 .	47.448982
he gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship .	81.54317
`` junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged ' ' ! !	17.375814
is one of mr . barcus ' strong beliefs .	34.287373
he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should take a more active part in encouraging the junior division ! !	60.879803
in closing , mr . barcus also wished all the juniors luck in their class .	21.57144
instead of 3 a . m . in the past , the juniors class at westminster was held at 4 45 p . m . .	10.648631
this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ! !	93.246925
before the juniors entered the ring the steward announced that after all juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs .	57.568367
from there on , each junior was going to be judged individually .	10.767571
this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the class had an entry of 46 juniors and it took approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the class .	53.21393
this year anne hone rogers , outstanding handler , judged the class .	20.897509
this is the third time in 28 years of junior showmanship at westminster that a lady handler has judged the class .	45.096367
as the juniors entered the ring , mr . spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that westminster has held the finals of the junior competition .	20.13378
juniors competed last year at american kennel club and canadian kennel club , recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this class -- the finals for the year .	13.763967
a junior who won two or more wins in the open class was eligible .	94.04287
( the purpose of the junior showmanship competition is to teach and encourage juniors to become good sportsmen .	62.504505
many adults showing at westminster today are products of this class .	14.772908
it seemed an almost impossible job for miss rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 juniors entered .	51.644283
a large number of these juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners .	24.097721
after the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring .	39.718983
she then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship .	98.22242
betty lou ham , age 16 , holyoke , mass . , showing an irish setter , was chosen as international champion of the year .	24.303755
she was awarded the professional handlers ' ass ' ns ' leonard brumby , sr . memorial trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the junior classes .	21.140312
betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year .	62.450996
in addition to showing an irish setter throughout the year , she also scored with an afghan .	27.752914
sydney le blanc , age 15 , staten island , n . y . , showing a doberman pinscher , was 2nd .	10.483028
susan hackmann , age 14 , from baltimore , md . , showing a dachshund , was 3rd .	16.467472
last year susan also placed 3rd in the finals at westminster .	4.219602
from the records we keep -- susan is the only junior who has placed in the junior classes in both united states and canada .	37.360413
karen marcmann , age 16 , trapp , penna . , showing a keeshond was 4th .	23.828941
most juniors who were entered in the finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in junior classes but score in the breed classes as well .	74.15455
in 1960 , there were 7287 entries in the junior classes .	19.786629
each year these shows have increased in entries .	8.6730385
next year 1962 , at westminster , the bench show committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more junior classes in the open division only to qualify for westminster .	110.070625
percy roberts , a leading judge will not be at the international show this year for the junior judging contest as he has been invited to judge in australia in march .	59.20311
it has been suggested many times that a class be set up for the juniors who are overage and cannot enter the junior classes .	33.208874
for some time this writer has been suggesting a junior judging class for intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the junior class .	38.839184
such a class was tried out successfully at the westchester kc show recently .	39.624825
not only were the contestants pleased with the class , but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day .	54.843163
the intermediates in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the judge .	80.87727
we suggested this class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows .	127.48122
at the recent horse show convention in new york it was stated that this intermediate judging class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world .	64.53815
this class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance .	88.59193
last year robert harris , a leading junior handler entered the dog judging contest ( junior ) at the international kc of chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any junior since the class ' inception .	42.1305
juniors who attend this chicago show should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help to them .	40.54494
superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed handler to judge junior showmanship competition .	15.3663
the founder of the junior showmanship competition the late leonard brumby , sr . ( for whom the trophy is named after at westminster ) was an outstanding handler and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division .	41.14624
some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a junior ' s ability to show a dog .	33.322536
to overcome this unfair judging , the a . k . c . requires that a licensed handler be present to judge the class .	49.772526
if the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from handlers , it has been suggested that licensed judges also be qualified to judge this class .	35.729523
by recognizing and helping juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners .	54.063847
the airedale terrier club of america and the kerry blue terrier club of america have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in junior showmanship competition at any show .	30.15647
the kansas city and the topeka kcs are arranging that juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for westminster .	61.002487
the rio grande kc is also considering having their junior classes set up so that juniors can qualify with points for westminster .	75.189606
the american pointer club is still continuing to donate trophies to juniors who win at junior showmanship classes with pointers .	9.913847
traveling through the south -- over 16 , 000 miles -- with two great danes , an afghan , and a persian kitten , we ' ve worked up a regular routine for acceptance at motels .	33.89475
my husband enters the motel office , signs up for a room , and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets .	23.263733
`` no ' ' , he replies , `` full grown , adult show dogs , housebroken , and obedience-trained ' ' .	34.42986
once settled , we ' re careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot , keep them under control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can ' t do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture .	93.42482
in the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin ! !	25.77107
many a motel owner -- when we ' ve stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children .	157.48001
so many times i have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination .	50.77963
is it that they don ' t care ? ?	4.269742
are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient ? ?	36.981483
at one time , to most americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the united states navy .	38.59086
today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport .	22.877653
there are more than 8 , 000 , 000 recreational boats in use in the united states with almost 10 , 000 , 000 the prediction for within the next decade .	32.257847
about 40 , 000 , 000 people participated in boating in 1960 .	44.52715
boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .	18.124683
boats are operated in every state in the union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the middle west .	24.302944
the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation ' s coastline .	26.171549
but during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short time ago , the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock .	50.595093
developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all over the country .	42.52988
no matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile lake texoma , located between texas and oklahoma , which resulted when the corp of army engineers dammed the red river .	41.535507
in 1959 , according to the engineers , lake texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1 , 000 , 000 persons .	33.48696
where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water .	60.13124
providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1 , 800 , 000 boat trailers now in use .	38.520718
it is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2 , 000 .	52.354946
the sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace .	73.507195
boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year- ' round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat .	42.168365
today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door .	27.68364
arriving at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun .	265.19586
and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago .	32.186077
this year , americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation ' s national , regional and local boat shows .	54.491264
the boats of america ' s trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons .	25.175476
the variety of craft on the country ' s waters today is overwhelming .	57.437935
they range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less than $50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100 , 000 .	27.511019
boat prices vary according to the buyer ' s desires or needs .	44.046387
in this respect , boats can be compared with houses .	111.0556
there is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget .	158.83705
there is no question as to just what is available .	23.342827
you name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models .	53.13591
there are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips .	58.869133
there are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience .	69.83569
you can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond .	61.602547
you may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal .	19.784397
you may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks .	22.99654
you may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose .	66.94668
designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat .	48.00904
you pay your money and you take your choice .	32.125145
american technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in american boating .	38.321484
i wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , americans excel over any country in the world in the long run .	83.83481
russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor , for instance .	29.47047
the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production .	60.85728
these engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage .	303.65143
their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook , the range being about $150 to $1 , 000 , depending on size .	45.705154
great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country	77.03469
and to making the owning of a boat simpler .	1275.32
there was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel .	24.398554
having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended .	72.929665
marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later .	158.72241
terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles .	92.11787
of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser ' s earning power , credit rating and local bank policy .	35.737106
outboard motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats .	25.142061
terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances .	55.277122
when the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go .	143.42432
when air travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all .	105.75758
man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft .	130.23654
it was much the same with pleasure boating at first .	53.19028
come one , come all , the water ' s fine ! !	37.59689
as the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do	66.0262
however , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating .	23.56463
laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower .	27.306293
what may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line .	41.985996
the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used .	54.51182
if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the u . s . coast guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on federal waterways .	47.188953
state numbering laws differ from each other in many ways .	26.186466
fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such as sailboats with no power , to be registered at all .	36.901546
many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators .	132.91515
generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities .	46.46798
it is always wise to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are .	105.36225
ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land	110.70564
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy .	129.72452
hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry ' s self originated and directed safety program .	67.615364
foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 .	26.09105
a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers .	62.16829
the industry has been its own watch dog .	3.965058
with u . s . coast guard cooperation , the american boat and yacht council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety .	51.410564
in 1959 , the yacht safety bureau was reorganized by the national association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment .	38.813484
a new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at atlantic city , new jersey , to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe .	51.231907
in addition to these activities , the naebm , with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue , new york city , as well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat .	47.751507
it is important to note the work of the united states power squadrons and the u . s . coast guard auxiliary .	13.451435
each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling .	51.210594
this year , over 100 , 000 persons will receive this free instruction .	88.85333
as america on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them .	35.68738
instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas .	6.538037
the word marina was coined by naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort .	51.388885
currently , marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleeping accommodations , a general store , and a grocery store .	44.095486
yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services .	27.653221
it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards .	84.55226
regardless of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas .	4.9745393
boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas .	95.422356
a recent survey disclosed there are about 4 , 000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the united states , the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats .	14.093898
the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement .	68.14942
in the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves .	60.68833
the main set of bars are the `` tappets ' ' and one tappet is connected to each lever .	13.207868
if the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time .	28.525234
close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars .	4.26492
these can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets .	22.100666
the number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented .	34.15855
in the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called `` dogs ' ' .	17.913683
two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar .	10.429771
these slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them .	18.496338
here ' s how the scheme works suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal .	22.724043
this also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars .	75.8636
the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets .	36.177505
by this scheme , pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal .	86.03785
interlocking signals are normally at stop or `` red ' ' position , and a lever must be pulled to `` clear ' ' the signal .	28.049313
this is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant ' ' .	53.193947
a turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points .	56.225174
a signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked .	38.590164
such locks are nearly always used where the switch points `` face ' ' oncoming traffic .	16.710121
the lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point .	61.861435
if the points aren ' t thrown all the way , the turnout cannot be locked , and in turn , the signal cannot be cleared .	27.426243
generally , these locks on turnouts are called `` facing point locks ' ' .	9.321894
figs . 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals .	31.801535
each diagram is accompanied by a `` dog chart ' ' , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled .	31.088875
the lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars .	10.682921
by studying the track-signal diagrams you ' ll note several other details .	63.668163
derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a `` stop ' ' signal -- are used in many instances .	38.99111
`` home ' ' signals have two blades .	5.804931
the blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move .	28.332853
as an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the `` distant ' ' signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant .	33.093422
in some low-speed situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution .	30.374481
in other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects .	87.465
the interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on paul larson ' s railroad follows the fig . 1 scheme and is shown beginning in fig . 7 , page 65 , and in the photos .	33.429256
here ' s how it can be built .	5.035495
the sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig . 7 , most of the bars being 1/8 ' ' ' ' brass in 1/4 ' ' ' ' and 1/2 ' ' ' ' widths .	16.01545
you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish .	70.015945
our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction .	26.594965
when cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk .	60.174465
start with the right-hand piece `` b ' ' , af , soldering it to the lower piece `` a ' ' of the same material but 12 ' ' ' ' long .	32.906906
let exactly 1 ' ' ' ' of `` a ' ' extend beyond `` b ' ' and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees .	50.042564
now lay 12 pieces of af cut 5-3/4 ' ' ' ' long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . .	45.048878
this gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece `` b ' ' .	7.484631
compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for `` b ' ' .	31.954372
solder this second `` b ' ' to `` a ' ' at right angles .	23.65722
there should be 10 ' ' ' ' between the two parallel members and each should be 1 ' ' ' ' from an end of the long piece .	50.15867
cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a af bar .	22.599243
tack-solder all the 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . pieces to the 10 ' ' ' ' and 12 ' ' ' ' members .	27.681427
these will be drilled and tapped later on .	94.74313
now cut five af locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) .	21.208693
position these using six intermediate temporary af spacers and locate the upper 12 ' ' ' ' bar `` a ' ' .	21.244028
solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame .	6.151959
now place 12 pieces 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4 ' ' ' ' long `` tappets ' ' , as they are called .	33.936928
cap with a af bar and tack-solder in place .	122.124535
cap the locking bar spacers with two af directly under the first two `` b ' ' pieces .	34.427685
mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together .	66.89649
placement of these holes is not critical , but they should be located so that the centers are about 1/8 ' ' ' ' from any edge .	38.206024
drill all no . 50 and counter-drill all except the `` a ' ' pieces size 43 .	148.5212
tap the `` a ' ' pieces 2-56 .	9.842033
now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12 ' ' ' ' and the first two 3-3/4 ' ' ' ' bars ( `` a ' ' and `` b ' ' pieces ) , which are soldered together .	18.000168
either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions .	152.74101
dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs .	22.270817
drill 20 no . 47 holes in the upper piece `` a ' ' as shown in fig . 7 .	23.117506
tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on .	958.3083
note , 6 and 8 lock levers don ' t require holes for contacts .	25.301798
now reassemble the frame , using af roundhead steel screws and nuts .	47.513565
put the 12 tappets and some af locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws .	19.577183
be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . spacer .	21.444324
as an anchor for the spring lock , insert a af bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in fig . 7 .	15.021492
drill a no . 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw .	17.782898
drill two no . 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2-56 .	28.040386
number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots .	32.931488
remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth .	31.471424
cut five pieces of af brass bar stock 3-3/4 ' ' ' ' long .	25.168701
these are supporting members for the short locking bars .	2.9280522
locate their positions in fig . 7 and drill no . 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame .	29.615906
cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut .	42.163403
drill four no . 19 and four no . 28 holes in the 12 ' ' ' ' long `` a ' ' pieces .	20.485626
draw-file no . 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends .	73.49991
break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer .	24.40831
drill a no . 50 hole 1-1/4 ' ' ' ' from one end and tap 2-56 .	13.754989
) put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar .	11.383247
to find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge .	22.045456
scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1/4 ' ' ' ' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 5/64 ' ' ' ' ) away from the frame edge .	21.625069
total distance is about 21/64 ' ' ' ' .	1.760676
tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4 ' ' ' ' tappet movement .	48.666824
drill a no . 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end .	21.383863
drill a no . 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in figs . 7 and 8 .	17.86394
repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars .	4.408514
to each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs . 6 and 8 .	20.670671
these will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts .	24.717651
fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times .	59.75682
as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible .	222.43724
a little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished .	54.24211
each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting .	24.562468
the order of fitting is not too important .	4.466121
however , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back .	64.88509
since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar .	68.562584
figs . 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions .	22.014614
all the bars are cut from af brass .	6.1687245
the lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of fig . 7 .	6.5996037
bar `` c ' ' is 2-3/4 ' ' ' ' long .	7.6952147
draw-file the edges , square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame .	19.123535
fig . 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes .	11.820786
center-punch and drill the no . 31 hole 7/16 ' ' ' ' from one end of the bar .	15.093855
chuck a length of 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8 ' ' ' ' long .	44.331707
cut the piece about 9/32 ' ' ' ' or 5/16 ' ' ' ' long and drive it into the no . 31 hole drilled in the locking bar .	25.317923
file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8 ' ' ' ' above the bar .	15.731957
this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 .	39.425957
place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 .	9.657446
scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece `` a ' ' .	29.831638
see the drawings for the shape of the notch .	44.608704
scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool .	123.09582
we used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about	70.059364
' ' thick and 1 ' ' ' ' dia . fitted on a 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . mandrel .	9.67799
such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts .	46.231586
a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one .	103.98415
endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible .	13.841727
the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it .	45.91239
assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces .	34.8131
all matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis .	82.51783
chuck a 2 ' ' ' ' or 3 ' ' ' ' piece of 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool .	15.296298
fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64 ' ' ' ' long on one end , using swiss pattern files .	42.240646
this tool can also be made with a lathe .	5.6279063
scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics .	58.414577
without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go ' round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn .	67.78617
math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor .	53.350235
it ' s not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science .	71.04366
but because science is based on mathematics doesn ' t mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician .	13.905297
a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems	160.69923
however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding .	44.421562
a mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .	42.65384
it places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed .	50.879124
the first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula .	28.93174
this changes the formula to an `` equation ' ' .	1.9417864
the equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .	12.255497
they involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes .	8.386161
however , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order .	39.724392
they indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition .	17.039248
the symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .	141.16685
the lower number is always divided into the upper number af	189.33282
the symbol for multiplication is `` **b ' ' .	2.2802212
it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row .	28.52854
numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order .	26.778929
the result will be the same regardless of the order used .	225.20139
the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .	30.383883
the number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol .	32.508778
when more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct .	33.98606
for example , for the problem af , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 .	54.50943
the symbol is used to separate two or more numbers .	24.547628
numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order .	33.38157
when solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value .	71.7788
multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right .	54.657722
completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps af .	82.86684
this would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 .	88.2906
this part of the equation would then become 4 .	1433.6523
for use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents .	3.7773511
the easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart .	118.35897
charts for this purpose are available from many sources .	15.469623
they are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments .	21.128008
the various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .	114.95236
shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result .	18.54274
a constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation .	27.1747
it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly .	31.18087
rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .	4.770458
the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events .	99.83186
when it is needed , one formula is as important as another .	49.81678
however , some formulas are used more than others .	36.251812
we ' ll take them in the general order of their popularity .	29.698387
a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine .	53.06887
displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume ' ' .	6.807961
most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions .	116.00541
it is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed .	58.66647
factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine ' s cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant .	21.383772
the constant is , which is one-quarter of 3 . 1416 , another constant known as `` pi ' ' .	27.235773
pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles .	63.106155
actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine .	35.49646
the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders .	17.56819
multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine ' s total displacement .	29.059984
dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches .	5.345509
dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc . ) .	5.5668063
one inch equals 2 . 54 centimeters one cubic inch equals 16 . 38 cubic centimeters .	9.335791
for example , let ' s consider a standard 283 cubic inch chevy aj .	20.90597
these engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches .	5.7067523
the formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes af .	46.866062
to arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right .	49.874016
a cylinder ' s compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder ' s volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber .	20.84091
cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .	19.450678
cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula af .	26.639692
to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head , install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level .	33.284203
then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface .	21.63691
this is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension .	133.62224
such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber .	62.691597
the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity .	51.96418
most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc . ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches .	22.706217
however , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters .	4.114216
the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used .	15.5784235
the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms .	23.274185
the volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket ' s thickness in thousandths of an inch .	19.915499
sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won ' t affect the final computation .	52.673225
the volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume .	4.7653465
another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position .	27.36917
compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth .	26.395111
this volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening .	10.658679
the total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume ' ' .	9.36653
after the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula af	32.540703
for an example let ' s dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches .	24.489626
applying these figures to the formula we get the equation af .	9.536737
this method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads .	44.635174
any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed .	20.025013
the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position .	46.148827
there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size .	11.159762
by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three .	44.06817
to simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors .	23.875624
tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly .	53.876575
this is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft .	9.135851
a tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made .	87.75792
any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics .	19.510872
when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula .	25.324913
to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is af .	11.344044
for an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4 . 00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look like this af	28.59168
to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is af .	35.99687
using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes af	19.952293
to determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors , the formula is af .	25.669285
using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes af .	7.5664454
-- the best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at ben white raceway has been that of mary liner ( mainliner-highland ellen ) , a member of the dick williams stable , who was clocked 2 25 .	27.436485
she is owned by ralph h . kroening , milwaukee , wis . , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud of her .	18.982864
other good miles have been by debonnie ( dale frost-debby hanover ) and prompt time ( adios-on time ) in 2 28- 36	12.785793
kimberly gal ( galophone-kimberly hanover ) 2 26 . 2	7.6670084
laguerre hanover ( tar heel-lotus hanover ) and monel ( tar heel-miracle byrd ) in 2 34 .	6.0422177
laguerre hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait .	79.83675
this colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them .	90.20998
monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races .	47.086605
stardel ( star ' s pride-starlette hanover ) , 2 34 , looks quite promising .	19.711868
fury hanover ( hoot mon-fay ) , caper ( hoot mon-columbia hanover ) and isaac ( hoot mon-goddess hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago .	22.283897
fury and caper worked in 2 35 and did it with ease .	184.13588
they are two good colts of different type .	3.4141169
fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and caper is more the compact type .	20.830444
i have never seen caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so .	78.55115
fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground .	46.34418
trackdown ( torrid-mighty lady ) has worked a mile in 2 33 . 3 .	9.784651
it took this colt several weeks to strike a pace .	81.477715
then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks .	17.284533
he has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse .	52.743347
thor hanover ( adios-trustful hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet .	89.724655
this colt arrived at the raceway early last november , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot .	61.56584
he appeared in the hopples about november 14 , was treated for worms on the 18th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace .	51.910324
on december 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all the way .	53.326885
this colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease .	85.16114
his best mile to date is 2 32 . 2 .	5.5270305
gamecock ( tar heel-terka hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2 32 . 2 .	16.406342
this is one of the best-tempered tar heels ever at the center .	46.4997
the first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare	80.4162
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff .	167.76494
the fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman .	72.16936
being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat .	166.12039
but up to date he has shown as much as any in the big simpson stable .	35.35981
hustler ( knight dream-torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and is right there with them , and sometimes leading them , in the best miles .	75.65144
torrid freight ( torrid-breeze on hal ) is a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him .	41.72966
strongheart ( adios-direct gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles .	48.214737
torrid adios ( torrid-adios molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts , but i like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds .	41.11317
blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks , he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me .	53.24271
first flyer ( frisco flyer-castle light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the illinois stakes .	22.092043
the colts in simpson ' s stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers .	28.644169
justine hanover ( sampson hanover-justitia hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2 32 . 4 weeks ago .	28.810165
mrs . freight ( knight dream-miss reed ) shows promise and does it in good form , and her best time is about 2 35 .	63.10895
hoopla ( tar heel-holiday hanover ) , a filly that wanted to trot , knocked herself october 31 and november 1 fighting the hopples .	103.62124
she was then trained on the trot until december 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again .	22.074482
this time she submitted and in a few days was going good .	94.397125
on january 11 she paced a mile in 2 43 . 1-- 38	18.578827
on jan . 21 , , 2 36 .	3.7201195
this filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , valentine day and cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning .	66.33976
she is more like her full brother , taraday hanover , but larger .	98.276764
up to date she is a grand-looking filly .	2.8882785
marquis pick ( gene abbe-direct grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time .	29.917402
he is a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of going .	131.3392
his best mile to date is 2 28- 33 .	4.0073647
majestic pick comes next , with a mile in 2 30- 33 . 2 .	11.21852
staley hanover ( knight dream-sweetmite hanover ) is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class .	128.2171
best time to date is 2 34- 34 .	5.7691703
step aside ( direct rhythm-wily widow ) has worked in 2 32 on the half-mile track and shows promise .	23.940617
most of billy haughton ' s 2-year-olds have worked from 2 40 to 2 35 .	41.104324
bonnie wick ( gene abbe-scotch mary ) has gone in 2 36	3.439904
hickory ash ( titan hanover-misty hanover ) in 2 35 .	3.2917442
the first time i saw the latter filly she trotted by me and i noticed such a family resemblance that i said to myself , `` that must be hickory ash ' ' .	35.72403
she is a beautiful filly and likes to trot .	2.3395486
hickory hill ( star ' s pride-venus hanover ) has gone in 2 33	9.189213

faber ' s kathy ( faber hanover-ceyway ) 2 37	42.969944
honor rodney ( rodney-honor bright ) around 2 40 .	101.34865
the last-named is a fine-looking , large colt , who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries .	60.79321
he is going sound again now , and looks good .	87.78212
brief candle ( harlan-marcia ) has gone in 2 37	20.362846
lena faber ( faber hanover-chalidale lena ) 2 33	19.162596

iosola hanover ( kimberly kid-isoletta hanover ) 2 36 .	3.1669738
the last-named is one of the favorites in the stable , and the boys like her very much .	76.36836
i will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future .	27.825266
i have just seen debonnie and prompt time work a mile in 2 34 , last quarter in 35 . 3 .	96.58198
in going away debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy .	29.003614
they left the three-quarters together and finished almost together .	54.927692
this filly is another adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise .	60.46967
after well broken and equipped with 12-oz . shoes on behind , bare-footed in front , she would trot a real storm with the master , delvin , driving .	47.53758
being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled .	2.2325034
she hesitated , she hopped , she rolled and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two weeks she started to pace , from that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds .	41.32506
rain on friday prevented many workouts , but there were a few miles of note on thursday .	54.985165

the average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he ' s always on the lookout for new and better arms .	82.318146
he ' s more than a reader of outdoor articles	196.63106
he ' s a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport .	13.278991
well , if you ' re that kind of sportsman we ' re here to help you .	52.83235
you ' ve probably given a lot of christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it ' s not easy to decide on a new one .	37.120773
you still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you ' d appreciate most	73.213425
the time to decide on them is now .	12.35301
as a christmas service , i ' ve taken a close look at this year ' s crop of new models .	35.84
here they are , with my comments and judgments .	13.237788
read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints .	182.33842
first on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense .	55.459797
for me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn ' t constitute a truly new design .	32.061974
such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change arms-making concepts .	68.45025
bill ruger ' s long-awaited deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans	27.946795
it ' s a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail .	77.39386
ruger reports that on his recent african safari the little magnum cartridge was a real work horse .	125.07084
small antelope were generally grassed with one shot , and the magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency	12.8937645
the deadliness of the magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me .	149.69426
at least five years ago , tom robinson of marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber , using the now defunct model 90 action in 20-gauge size .	101.57671
after figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in marlin ' s underground test gallery .	115.14008
we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill ruger in his first experiments three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group .	76.015366
ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet .	17.26538
the new , jacketed slug in magnum corrected this .	65.623146
but even without jacketed bullets , i had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year .	83.94249
within half an hour i jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket , and i caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards .	27.847918
he moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling .	40.186394
three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills .	55.535007
my double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ) , and although it compares well in other respects , it ' s considerably heavier than the deerstalker , which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds .	30.155828
if ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it .	20.179188
the deerstalker points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull is light and sharp .	30.821445
the 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1 , 850 fps , which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges .	22.675282
with five shots at the immediate command of the hunter ' s trigger finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination .	23.705952
the second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the	44.71824
at present it ' s available in one model , the fine and familiar smith & wesson magnum revolver ( about $110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms .	25.605751
, 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2 , 460 fps , and it ' s the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range .	18.306171
this is a varmint load , pure and simple	2241.9348
it ' s much too explosive for small edible game .	11.364493
it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers .	15.680548
the most intriguing aspect of the s & w magnum chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard	168.4503
rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers .	8.044318
you may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( jet vs . rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting .	37.11374
i tested it in my scoped s & w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun steadily .	82.125916
the fact that the deerstalker and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn ' t mean that 1961 didn ' t see changes in models , actions and calibers .	71.50325
aside from the ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time .	17.934856
here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models .	23.303991
newcomers to the american hunter are the browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles .	14.240867
they have fine fn actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood .	64.03529
barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $165 ) plus the magnums ( around $170 )	20.168406
shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the magnums except the	13.691844
stock designs are excellent for use with scopes .	24.149202
colt ' s center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with sako actions , regardless of caliber .	27.622671
, af and the magnums , the long action ( about $135 for the standard coltsman and $200 for the custom version ) .	55.859123
previously , fn actions were used for the larger cartridges .	23.330198
auto , the sport-king , in two grades -- field and special ( less than $45 and just over $45 , respectively ) .	116.05842
it ' s a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made .	5.174093
magnum rim-fire rifles , 1961 ' s lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ) .	16.78562
previously known as jefferson arms , kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle	30.05739
marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings .	16.721794
the model 99 ( under $45 ) is a light-weight , streamlined	7.9844666
rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles .	866.35156
it ' s extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle i tried was completely trouble-free in functioning .	85.322754
the 989 ( about $40 ) is an even newer	624.49066
auto , this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip .	4.053555
once again the mossberg targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination .	47.779446
the bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even though it ' s only 3-1/2 inches long .	76.299706
you can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with	19.038656
shotshells -- to break the little targo clay targets .	238.9416
a trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets .	26.770494
a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available .	94.591095
you can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the 340tr ( about $40 ) or a single-shot , the 320tr ( $10 less ) .	26.209747
the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it ' s tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds .	53.90952
they ' ll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it ' s almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark .	51.685772
the combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds , right now ! !	73.64898
big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the and to the list of model 725 ' s .	53.97609
these are made on special order only , in kodiak grade ( about $310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads	16.36808
a shortened version of the highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 .	11.15091
this carbine ( under $140 , about $15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year ' s model 760 pump with a short-barrel .	38.82872
this design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard .	38.317234
presently , the 742c is available in af .	2.2846532
the latest versions of the famous savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 deluxe ( under $135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design .	15.999981
the replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate .	85.686516
a fresh crop of beginners ' guns showed up in 1961 , and they ' re good bets for your christmas gift list if you ' re wondering what to get for a youngster .	38.351635
the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49 ( about $20 , $5 for a saddle scabbard ) -- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous winchester lever-action and featuring the western look .	21.266973
because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model .	219.49591
the action is a drop-block , handling all the standard	58.547928
marlin ' s latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it ' s a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock .	33.079327
this is the model 122 ( about $20 )	1.1911147
it ' s a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety -- i . e . , the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot .	22.231104
stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun .	37.949524
single-shot remington 514c ( around $20 ) , which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short -- 12-1/2-inch -- stock	18.230225
it ' s just right for a boy of 12-1/2 .	6.9425917
a beginner ' s shotgun has also been introduced this year .	46.6743
the single-barrel stevens 940y ( under $35 ) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren ' t strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily .	85.33887
this gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or gauge .	52.30621
there ' s another addition to the stevens line , the pump-action model 77 in ( under $75 ) , which you may or may not consider a kid ' s gun	41.09753
many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too .	25.010563
although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market .	75.261925
for example , a browning trap version of the superposed over/under , the broadway ( from $350 up , depending on grade ) , differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting .	20.084665
the colt line now includes a new scattergun , the standard or custom pump model ( about $90 and $150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 .	49.58363
firearms international has introduced another import , this one from finland .	37.222874
it ' s the valmet ( about $170 ) , a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices .	123.78702
high standard has also added two models to its line .	96.42671
the supermatic trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto .	36.005238
the flite-king trophy ( beginning at just over $85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16 .	21.926298
either model is a very good dollar value .	3.408328
mossberg ' s latest contribution to the field is the model 500 ( from $73 . 50 )	39.810127
this is an improved version of the old model 200 , a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun .	15.854346
see page 24 for a complete report on it .	51.717762
jet -- which i coupled with the deerstalker carbine as one of the year ' s two biggest developments -- few significant innovations appeared among 1961 ' s handguns .	56.7552
livery stable -- j . vernon , prop . ' ' .	11.207675
coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old wells fargo building in san francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years .	34.64172
john vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom .	14.881982
he had two interests in life the pleasures of the table and driving .	41.725967
twice a week he drove his tallyho over the santa cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the pacific at the other .	37.907265
the journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze .	58.750793
the southward route was the classic run in california , and the most fashionable .	28.824701
his patronage on this stretch was made up largely of san franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself .	52.879887
they did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco .	85.47154
breakfast was at the palace hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at boulder creek or at santa cruz .	58.414967
gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals .	62.133236
then the chinese hostler , who rode with vernon on the box , would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp .	16.304928
in spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine .	49.79848
they gathered roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare santa lucia fir , which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains .	26.249977
in the spanish days franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense .	14.875964
it yields a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar .	13.639212
vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he was glad when the trips dropped off , and the botanists began to motor out by themselves .	34.814594
my friend often breakfasted with vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run .	26.246847
this was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table .	83.21528
vernon ' s office adjoined the stable , and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs , the folk art of the period .	13.670801
they advertised harness polish , liniments , ball ' s rubber boots , green river whiskey , hood ' s sarsaparilla , patent medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco .	9.216951
the hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove	19.262568
then a porter from manning ' s fish house would trot in with a tray on his head .	40.14198
it was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters .	14.198776
vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and manning ' s had been famous for them since the civil war .	32.93165
oyster salt roast -- oysters on the half shell , cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served -- was a standby at manning ' s .	35.96324
its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy .	63.89185
in the 1890 ' s the palace hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager , john c . kirkpatrick .	38.664116
this dish much resembles the oysters rockefeller made famous by antoine ' s in new orleans , though the palace chef announced it as a variant of manning ' s roast oysters .	19.403004
( gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the palace ' s or antoine ' s .	60.926647
antoine ' s held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding .	14.606025
) vernon , however , held out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a bit of lemon .	41.272987
after the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig	22.30742
this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned .	242.18599
the tallyho had cost vernon $2 , 300 .	11.245316
a replica of two coaches made in england for the belmont club in the east , and matchless west of the rockies , it was the despair of whips on the santa cruz run .	18.048641
one could shave in the reflection of its french-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels .	27.121967
departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals .	36.61505
but for the start of the santa cruz run , the whip fell .	23.071733
the clients boarded the tallyho at the palace promptly at seven .	71.03655
they had been fed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identified with fox hunting , was on the bill .	55.22941
there are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of which is right .	58.87882
here is an original kedgeree recipe from the family club ' s kitchen	30.500214
flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled eggs , some buttery white sauce done with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a bit of anchovy .	9.7303095
the omelet named for ernest arbogast , the palace ' s chef , was even more in demand .	50.830807
for decades it was the most popular dish served in the ladies ' grill at breakfast , and it is one of the few old palace dishes that still survive .	46.14972
native california oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it .	31.274195
fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg .	9.514806
a jigger of dry sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a hundred of the little oysters .	63.28835
louis sherry once stayed a fortnight at the palace , and he was so pleased with omelet arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in new york j . pierpont morgan had come in his private train to san francisco , to attend an episcopal convention , and brought the restaurateur with him .	37.902027
as things happened , morgan was installed in the nob hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent .	30.28621
sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could .	70.67008
twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the santa cruz tour under vernon ' s guidance .	27.436548
in the grand court of the palace , notable for its tiers of moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , vernon ' s station was at the entrance .	33.846046
it was a post of honor , held inviolate for him	68.762566
of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late general winfield scott , who was said to be the most imposing general of his century , if not of all centuries .	41.570866
vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly .	10.313445
promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho .	86.956985
he had style he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them .	28.294226
they cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached woodside where the santa cruz uplands begin .	33.983143
the road maps of the region have changed since 1905	12.692422
inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names .	258.25967
once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing .	69.57677
an agreeable ease suffused vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke .	52.43687
vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar .	11.773523
they were no more on parade than was their driver	172.12616
one fork of the road was as good as another .	11.561181
the santa cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the santa clara valley below at the left .	35.569214
the water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery .	4.5067
you arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh .	42.85855
vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage .	40.942707
a number of them must have fallen into disfavor	1.5229936
they were struck out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management .	40.138985
he was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat .	67.68037
the horses seemed to know these by instinct , he used to say such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins .	46.54654
there was wright ' s , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers .	33.845062
many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet , and lived there to the end of their days .	41.82122
it was the haunt of writer ambrose bierce , who admired its redwoods .	12.76376
acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to berkshires ) , whose `` carcass sweepstakes ' ' were renowned .	11.050605
their ham butts , cured in oak-log smoke , were also esteemed when roasted or boiled , and served with this original sauce	29.0017
put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic cloves .	14.151978
contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime .	7.4958067
after this has simmered an hour , add two tablespoons each of worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of sherry .	8.2868395
every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so that when its turn came , it was properly mellowed .	34.858856
vineyards and orchards also grew around wright ' s , and deer were rather a nuisance	43.031315
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers .	3.016468
but no one complained when they wound up , regardless of season , in venison pies .	47.344425
no one complained of the white wine either at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint .	20.692284
( the almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height .	20.533806
though creeks in the santa cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle .	62.648987
dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets .	15.432905
the merit of the pie , vernon believed , was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven .	54.558434
the recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote down in his ledger , is basically this	61.67044
peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set aside .	19.272577
in a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay leaf .	16.76162
let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain .	79.99516
poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool .	22.56274
set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg .	20.557627

built upon seven hills , istanbul , like rome , is one of the most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast .	25.551226
it is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses .	44.15123
at the moment , many of these are being pulled down .	95.45298
whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the bosphorus and the golden horn .	29.943714
even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents .	84.614136
for almost 3 , 000 years europe and asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets .	45.961197
founded in the ninth century b . c . it was called byzantium 200 years later when byzas , ruler of the megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself .	36.90306
about a thousand years after that , when the roman empire was divided , it became capital of the eastern section .	53.65027
on may 11 , 330 , a . d . , , its name was changed again , this time to constantinople after its emperor , constantine .	52.212852
in 1453 when the last vestige of ancient roman power fell to the turks , the city officially shifted religions -- although the patriarch , or pope , of the orthodox church continued to live there , and still does -- and became the capital of the ottoman empire .	44.677708
when that was broken up after the first world war , its name was changed once more .	63.754322
rich in christian and moslem art , istanbul is today a fascinating museum of east and west that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the bosphorus and the sea of marmara only a short distance from the center of town .	36.571907
easy to get to , and becoming more popular every year , it is only fourteen hours from new york by pan american world airways jet , four hours from rome .	70.5838
most of the sights lie in the old section across the golden horn from the modern hotels .	73.163414
i started my tour of them at the turkish government tourist office , next to pan american ' s office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the hilton hotel .	77.603905
from there i turned left along cumhuriyet cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left , republic gardens , and came in a few moments to taksim square , one of the hubs of the city , with the monument of the republic , erected in 1928 , in its center .	37.779804
directly across from the gardens i found a bus stop sign for t 4 and rode it down to the bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before i reached the water and the entrance to dolmabahce palace immediately after that .	60.60346
there the bus turned right along the bosphorus , past ocean liners at anchor , to galata bridge over the entrance to the golden horn , a brown sweep of water that empties into the bosphorus .	21.900469
across the bridge on the left i saw st . sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the blue mosque .	20.602322
on the other side of the golden horn i rode through eminonu square , with yeni cami , or the new mosque , which dates from the seventeenth century , just across from the entrance to the bridge .	18.731735
passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on the right and pandelli ' s , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it .	37.42791
at the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park .	68.001526
i got off there , crossed the street , walked ahead with st . sophia on my left , the blue mosque on my right , and in a moment came to the entrance of st . sophia .	22.660543
erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous st . sophias , the first of which was begun by constantine , this fourth church was started by justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later .	33.987083
on his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than solomon ' s in jerusalem .	15.038768
a few years later the dome fell in .	533.9387
nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of the eastern empire , where the byzantine emperors were crowned .	17.048727
after the turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque , adding the stubby minarets .	18.10522
in the second half of the sixteenth century , sinan , the great architect who is the michelangelo of the east , designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome .	33.56675
with the birth of the turkish republic after the first world war , st . sophia became a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plastered over by the moslems , whose religion forbids pictures in holy places , have been restored .	33.118916
inside over the first door i saw one of these , which shows constantine offering the city to the virgin mary and justinian offering the temple .	36.395355
on the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with arabic writing .	60.031452
the eight green columns , i learned , came from the temple of artemis at ephesus , the others , red , from the temple of the sun at heliopolis .	25.562824
beneath the dome i saw the spot where the byzantine emperors were crowned , a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence .	31.20722
behind this is a minber or moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sat .	44.40179
directly opposite is the emperor ' s door , through which they entered the building .	46.275345
outside st . sophia i walked through the flower garden in front of it , with the blue mosque ahead on my left .	36.81478
across the street on my right i saw the hippodrome , now a park .	25.171707
it was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games .	70.58676
statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of crusaders .	19.290161
at the beginning of the hippodrome i saw the kaiser ' s fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the german emperor , and on my left , directly across from it , the tomb of sultan ahmet , who constructed the blue mosque , more properly known by his name .	31.210674
just before coming to the mosque entrance i crossed the street , entered the hippodrome , and walked ahead to the obelisk of theodosius , originally erected in heliopolis in egypt about 1 , 600 b . c . by thutmose , who also built those now in new york , london and rome at the lateran .	19.430117
this one was set up here in 390 a . d . on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them .	30.876062
beyond it i noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the serpentine column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the temple of apollo at delphi , greece .	18.14311
near the end of the hippodrome i came upon the built column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the colossus of rhodes .	51.101986
retracing my steps to the mosque of sultan ahmet , only one with six minarets , i entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle .	31.62587
one of the most beautiful buildings in istanbul , it was constructed in the early years of the seventeenth century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade down from it , and smaller full domes around the gallery .	28.74983
the round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer .	55.006355
inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets .	18.832523
back at the kaiser ' s fountain , i walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the column of constantine , also known as the burnt column , at the top on my right .	58.281
it stands in the middle of what was once the forum of constantine , who brought it from rome .	36.525227
i stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , bayezit , with the bayezit mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it .	52.89023
there i got off , crossed the square , and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant , hard to come by in this part of the city .	52.49928
called the marmara gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing the way there , and has a terrace overlooking the sea of marmara .	30.613834
after lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street i found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet , flaky cake -- in istanbul .	33.98893
it ' s a great favorite of the university students , and i joined them there for dessert .	112.07804
taking the streetcar back to kaiser ' s fountain , i walked ahead , then left down the street opposite st . sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which is the entrance to the sunken palace .	29.107199
actually an underground cistern , its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars , it was built by justinian in the sixth century to supply the palace with water .	33.853416
i found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately .	44.849598
outside i walked past the entrance to st . sophia , turned left at the end of it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead .	36.31035
just before reaching it i came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an oriental pagoda , with arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the fountain of sultan ahmet .	25.461514
going through the imperial gate in the wall , i entered the grounds of topkapi palace , home of the sultans and nerve center of the vast ottoman empire , and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the church of st . irene , completed by constantine in 330 a . d . on my left , and then , just outside the second gate , i saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right -- the executioner ' s spring , where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims .	29.657484
passing through the gate , with towers on either side once used as prisons , i entered a huge square surrounded by buildings , and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in english for each building .	96.94427
at one time about 10 , 000 people lived there .	471.33383
following arrowed signs , i veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world ' s greatest collections of chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services .	37.34247
next to it is a copper section , with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe .	40.618877
in the court once more , i went right toward the reception house , a long one-story building with a deep portico .	43.0538
going through a door into another small court , i had the throne room directly in front .	27.778708
i walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the treasury , which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on which the sultans sat cross-legged .	49.68756
they are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels .	6.9424543
taking the path behind the throne room to the building directly beyond it , the portrait gallery , i went right at the end of it , through a garden to a small building at the back -- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs .	40.554657
( do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals .	25.832365
keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease .	58.052563
do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat .	70.98329
don ' t forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces .	11.805536
clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly .	6.089718
do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit .	41.36023
make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such .	56.866863
don ' t fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops .	16.97209
sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results .	30.678484
do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them .	39.229343
if doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half .	28.261528
if necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time .	9.842012
for roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone .	44.925694
also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals .	73.05176
don ' t practice a new recipe on guests .	64.469795
have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right .	47.424057
do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it .	34.659607
keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator .	13.909123
don ' t plan meals that are too complicated .	20.374645
limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories .	18.314545
do whatever kitchen work , such as fixing a salad , preparing garlic bread , or making a marinade sauce , ahead of time .	33.707703
when you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen .	24.954807
( this goes for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins .	129.61082
don ' t think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world .	32.405804
the simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef .	17.581516
do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up , flames cannot reach the meat .	112.36217
don ' t forget to have a supply of melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use .	5.336281
made of the world ' s toughest unbreakable plastic , melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors .	47.737156
there is even one set that has `` barbecue ' ' written on it .	37.379005
it ' s cheaper to buy wall-tex and cover your outdoor table .	88.86338
or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues .	53.63426
oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best .	30.998075
don ' t forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler , which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments .	47.95285
there are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes .	54.336884
with them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in a-1 condition .	32.41063
except when you prepare `` do it yourself ' ' shish kebob or a lobster roast .	12.408493
then you ' ll want terry cloth towels for mopping up .	13.100194
don ' t think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal .	61.582134
in the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace .	9.933468
even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside .	118.356834
summertime supper , outside , is a natural .	228.7995
you ' ll find , once your technique is perfected , that you can cook on a boat with a simple bernz-o-matic .	22.919586
get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot .	10.550389
be sure to get a few more than you need .	61.60454
you will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one , use six for drinks , serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen -- and need one more to mix the salad dressing .	64.07512
don ' t forget the joys of a meal on the road .	26.766026
if you travel over the vast u . s . a . you will , no doubt , discover that feeding is an expensive business .	53.532757
decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work .	32.42108
a picnic bag , a grill , a cooler for soft drinks and beer , and for frozen convenience foods .	17.553497
eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings	1.5297986
turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas ( gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and -- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up , hamburger , buns , an array of relishes , and fresh fruit -- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant , and 100% more fun .	54.827473
you need a little stove , a coffee pot and a stew pot	11.692378
maybe a skillet , a basket of essentials like salt , pepper , plates , forks , knives and a can opener .	29.205973
as you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night , visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal .	66.405716
for 25-cents load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car .	33.009903
spice is a fact of life in the u . s . a . .	8.861434
you only have to think of franks and sausages to know what i mean .	50.963036
go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat , salami , vienna sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties .	8.870411
threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a bit of green pepper , a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast .	31.578861
sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite .	131.1781
a story goes that a certain herr feuchtwanger of st . louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers .	53.279167
so that his customers should not soil their hands , feuchtwanger issued white gloves .	79.13832
discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise .	111.739395
he had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks .	19.521648
years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the `` first to go ' ' at the new york polo grounds .	24.237118
the nation ' s number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill .	17.075706
either way it ' s hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation .	53.96624
to make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips	365.40027
-- score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through .	89.589
this permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking .	31.311491
-- relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns .	124.2657
bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd .	14.363908
-- using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too .	17.444082
watch closely while browning them , as it doesn ' t take long .	10.888654
-- an unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in french dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic .	14.5714655
contrary to popular opinion , `` a la mode ' ' doesn ' t mean `` with ice cream ' ' -- it just means , in the latest style .	36.08148
here are a couple of the latest , highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard ! !	58.915382

to prepare mustard cream , blend mustard with enough water to make a thin paste .	39.769203
fold into whipped cream and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika .	7.5178585
a back-yard picnic with grilled frankfurters and a selection of frankfurter trimmings is a fine way to entertain guests this summer .	40.299118
be sure to have plenty of frankfurters and buns on hand .	29.758472

instructions for preparing clay , drying , glazing and firing are not given .	51.316235
ceramic modeling clay red , white or buff .	32.023476
glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions .	17.125315
use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking .	20.229668
they must be free of oil , wax and dust .	36.088146
the size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed .	29.388195
roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions .	4.410293
whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay .	11.50681
when mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns .	439.26736
place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects	51.44059
experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) .	42.90733
place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold .	92.56029
to obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges .	61.475693
check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay .	37.885494
be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles .	49.497833
allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) .	82.33189
to release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project	128.402
gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold .	118.151405
slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold .	52.818184
place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action .	23.123085
this will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired .	35.457287
place project on table and carefully lift the mold off .	48.019997
study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections .	4.090079
if clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers .	62.32281
if the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush .	38.518642
make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) .	83.577484
leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping .	20.802864

hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat .	105.711395
menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view .	14.308502
youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet .	14.176559
the gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit .	5.157286
all are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern .	57.62412
and with passenger weight shifted forward , hotei levels off for speed under power of a merc 800 .	170.81378
the 80-hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard ! !	89.39799
with only two aboard , hotei does better than 27 mph -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop .	48.078262
she also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser .	68.313034
we ' ve been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry .	101.21511
a lot of thought went into storage space construction .	53.082207
there ' s a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items .	44.48131
the cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life jackets , etc . .	31.63018
the aft cockpit has a af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat .	41.19802
on each side of the motor well there ' s storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below .	63.19984
the well itself is designed to take two merc 800 ' s or 500 ' s if you wish and there ' s room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it .	57.77892
needless to say , you can ' t build hotei in a couple of weeks .	38.713837
our building time was slightly over 400 hours -- but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware was under $800 .	30.399843
a comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3 , 000 .	12.024039
consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3 , 000 and your building time is well worth it .	42.54894
a gator trailer , model 565 , is used to transport the boat to the waterways .	16.46288
this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years .	20.048813
all framing in hotei is one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings .	55.307865
therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc . , on a table saw .	61.474785
besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze stronghold nails ( made by independent nail & packing co . , bridgewater , mass . ) are used extensively in assembly and weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints .	25.41736
construction follows a thorough study of the drawings .	2.3196893
start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor .	31.348856
draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other .	53.813824
in this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes .	54.515915
the transom frame is made first with the joints lapped , glued and fastened with one-inch , no . 12 stronghold nails .	18.369116
after notching it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails .	25.702028
all frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , no . 12 nails .	26.80252
the frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines .	3.56019
if notched for the battens , they would require more work , be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through .	69.65222
nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking .	16.950281
the jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete .	33.954685
this is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction .	42.30653
be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required .	93.16249
after the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced , a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson .	24.532953
the frames are glued and screwed to this piece .	3.62855
the joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated fiberglas cloth and nailed .	22.368145
it is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced .	15.590743
the keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is next installed .	162.57838
the first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two .	15.103885
the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first .	13.103965
note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end .	49.26128
one-inch , no . 10 screws are used in both cases .	17.946129
a stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one .	80.13604
take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four .	68.08381
then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig .	44.095257
the first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames .	14.995692
the second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member .	42.756115
they ' re glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson .	7.600108
a number of c clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets .	44.36586
the battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames .	73.88905
glue and 1-1/2-inch , no . 10 screws are used .	14.223755
placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens .	110.661835
with the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling .	33.87044
the chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending .	39.45982
fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple jig .	54.910072
i clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of sure grips .	25.528841
the aluminum , flush against the battens , acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily .	47.363426
if you don ' t own a planer and don ' t want to buy one , it ' s well worth renting .	24.749672
the planking is five-ply , 3/8-inch-thick weldwood royal marine plywood .	3.4244566
this can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long .	11.499392
plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , no . 12 stronghold nails at all battens , the stem and the transom .	26.0695
another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening .	14.15426
the best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off .	199.0617
i used a homemaster routo-jig made by porter cable for this job .	26.838964
it ' s good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw .	28.535933
when cut , the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming .	46.069016
then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens .	38.57576
it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings .	3.8250778
the next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points .	69.034164
the bottom planking is applied in the same manner .	6.655253
after planking , the bottom gets a layer of fiberglas .	4.786182
the spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws .	24.529577
then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation .	25.595232
since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area .	14.382265
the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time .	19.389256
a 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches .	82.90802
lay the cloth in place and trim it to size .	84.841995
then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin .	22.8787
when the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish .	64.74926
i used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener .	47.53097
using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth .	20.95481
when the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint roller .	16.249828
be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden .	14.145444
when the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail .	19.365759
then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem .	9.267557
before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline .	6.30728
fiberglas materials are available from glass plastic supply co . , 1605 w . elizabeth ave . , linden , n . j . .	11.814819
the hull is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level , well-braced position .	65.972
i laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem , also installing a bow eye at this time .	30.194902
for added strength , i also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint .	33.755974
again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed .	27.832624
after trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is installed .	29.410337
this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom .	38.019665
these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry .	39.44083
when they ' re on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten .	37.458485
the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom brace .	47.191936
note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces .	64.0705
all the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood .	2.2141879
most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring .	5.9788885
these battens are glued and screwed to the frames .	1.8365006
with all deck battens in place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line .	14.02692
use one coat of firzite and one coat of marine paint .	13.601387
bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place .	23.938099
after the decking is on , the cabin sides are installed .	82.97366
they ' re followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated .	27.780376
the windshield glass is shatterproof and plexiglas is used in the cabin .	11.253718
inside , bunks are framed up and installed as indicated .	73.091934
a head is a handy thing to have and i installed one under a removable section of the port bunk .	30.72114
the sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink .	16.62901
for padding the seats and bunks , i used ensolite , type aj .	66.32916
lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement .	33.929153
available in af sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot .	133.72026
it is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year ' round retreat complete in every detail .	217.04135
because of the unique design by the architect egils hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time .	21.510267
most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools .	38.399853
on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim .	75.7228
in recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind .	74.87223
it is a big project , not to be taken lightly .	41.80191
but each step has been broken down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman .	27.235598
the idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization .	6.674744
everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials .	34.146233
wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting .	75.999565
we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan .	70.07874
thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend .	31.75145
the roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days .	71.0707
then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure .	19.107248
due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find out what , if any , they are .	39.236618
close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used	23.614529
in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all .	41.376514
this can usually be found out at the nearest town hall .	68.209526
at the same time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as well as possible zoning regulations .	8.992549
whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or l-p gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) .	64.44908
be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion .	62.04261
if there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form .	98.03876
where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one .	211.02606
in many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector .	58.27108
these will be available at cost from our plans department .	177.0039
some general things to look for in a site , if you haven ' t already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation .	45.91852
how are the roads , and how will they stand up ? ?	96.803795
a visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative .	19.226482
note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from .	83.1822
will the view be something you can live with ? ?	41.1859
don ' t worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain	8.005533
we will take up alternative foundations later on .	171.46033
with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( aja version ) and the expandable ( ajb version ) .	17.722843
this will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony .	32.90299
this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost .	85.82195
bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues .	29.95618
the wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard af and af of a good grade , free from structural faults .	44.60697
they should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected .	56.58264
the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer .	95.83114
the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired .	40.189518
all panel board comes in standard af foot size .	186.2517
it is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame .	11.985583
the fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound .	16.072008
the louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation .	53.978916
there are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them .	122.74103
the door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade .	37.900543
the filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage .	114.97352
the battens covering the joints are of af stock and are applied after the walls are erected .	67.92455
all nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended .	63.36112
note if 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in af , af , and af can be used in making the glass panels .	49.020103
other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim .	42.525623
in any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels .	27.627907
with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool .	38.80202
the drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed .	40.371323
there is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted .	30.507027
the size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column .	94.44391
a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle .	62.393078
a new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle .	40.22839
the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work .	55.9627
the drill press should be leveled and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws .	56.263123
a coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table	18.559572
wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill .	15.7038145
presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill .	60.37015
the rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush .	24.891317
be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease .	59.26895
belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount .	20.27972
keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won ' t slip when pulled by hand	96.32387
excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings .	10.261091
most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position .	35.305264
the return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved .	64.37282
turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it .	71.57455
some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key	9.696297
otherwise , you ' ll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use .	74.52978
drill speeds are important if you want a good job .	11.694181
each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked .	99.88539
on most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys .	28.171972
you will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool .	129.59636
see the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds .	42.402676
generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed .	204.16612
too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools .	161.84274
too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge .	44.84036
the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate .	70.15223
there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes .	52.02047
the most common are the twist drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit .	48.564617
all will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don ' t cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts .	37.800213
the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade .	28.47394
since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding .	63.95144
fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well out of the way .	36.915897
when drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath .	29.21162
this will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough .	34.677135
another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side .	102.68903
in soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due to the varying hardness of the wood .	32.610386
in this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy .	45.026524
when a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark .	55.18092
the depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth .	59.33617
the old-time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects .	23.830952
for their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered .	29.567417
in this sequence i shall write about them in the order of their erection .	14.179957
the first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected newbury ( now newburyport ) with salisbury point .	63.929268
its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly newburyport men , petitioned the general court for an act of incorporation .	27.427816
this document began `` no . 1 newbury port , may 30th , 1791	25.128666
`` whereas , a bridge over merrimack river , from the land of hon ' ble jonathan greenleaf , esquire , in newbery , to deer island , and from said island to salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe conveyance to carriages , teams and travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all times of tide .	22.408989
`` we , the subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribed to this , or a similar writing , we will present a petition to the hon ' ble general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts , praying for an act incorporating into a body politic the subscribers to such writing with liberty to build such a bridge , and a right to demand a toll equal to that received at malden bridge , and on like terms , and if such an act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares set against our respective names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of money at such times and in such manners , as by the said proposed corporation , shall be directed and required ' ' .	72.832535
this paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares .	11.873013
a month later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that the bridge was to be built .	20.832966
the matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the court granted a charter on january 9 , 1792 .	68.03746
on november 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened .	27.409082
timothy palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex , or `` deer island ' ' bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of william coombs , who received $300 as recompense .	33.139587
this two-part bridge is best described by rev . timothy dwight , president of yale college , in his `` travels in new-england and new-york ' ' , published in new haven in 1821 .	12.44279
`` it consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore .	37.311188
the division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch	231.78337
whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark .	26.588238
in appearance and construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge .	22.077703
the whole length of essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four .	21.77349
i have already mentioned that mr . timothy palmer of newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country .	12.094945
as mr . palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature	67.28874
he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention ' ' .	13.752319
it is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby rowley	66.92361
that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was sixteen years old	28.16488
and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , moody spofford .	14.937674
it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth , haverhill , and philadelphia .	51.179546
the essex merrimack bridge when first built was not covered .	61.36215
as far as we know , no american bridge had been thus protected in 1792 .	68.49563
richard s . allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 .	31.011288
its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the `` massachusetts magazine ' ' in may 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( fig . 1 ) .	14.597705
a brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber .	28.527994
between the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet	37.442772
between the north shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long .	20.974916
a dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place july 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island .	44.9386
it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion .	32.89407
the `` essex journal ' ' says that he `` delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly ciceronian ' ' .	47.546635
the reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because dexter ' s oration could hardly be understood	21.870136
and , although he later explained that he was talking french , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening .	28.08054
the north portion of the essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning .	78.8157
it stood in its original form until 1882 .	10.23495
the southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation .	40.965908
in 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge .	24.362118
this was built by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette county , pennsylvania .	31.727333
timothy palmer had general supervision of the work .	7.3064013
an advertisement in the `` newburyport herald ' ' , december 21 , 1810 , shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges .	60.87446
information is hereby given that mr . timothy palmer of newburyport , mass . has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the chain bridge , in the states of massachusetts , new hampshire , vermont , rhode island , and connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges .	20.176868
`` mr . palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it .	49.569057
this chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end .	29.568333
it fell , february 6 , 1827 , carrying with it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen .	77.72701
the horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned .	4.2880597
in spite of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on july 17 , 1827 .	24.673445
this second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway .	22.932013
the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 , when the county commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways .	25.686222
sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site , may 28th to june 3rd .	46.875137
colonel frederick w . lander , impersonated , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott ' s ( now college ) hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel benjamin f . kelley ' s ( west ) virginia infantry , then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates .	34.414227
he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction	237.9794
that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the ' 60s .	52.564857
the bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years .	45.598183
twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister .	31.207205
it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on u . s . route 250 -- the old beverly and fairmont turnpike .	49.18401
it is one of the very few , if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the u . s . highway system , thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days .	39.07178
this covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of june 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story .	37.05875
so frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known structures in west virginia .	88.70652
completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth and his brother , eli , of beverly .	21.672161
the chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike a dozen years before , as well as many other bridges for several counties .	62.1085
the philippi bridge , however , was the chenoweth master piece , with its 139-foot , dual lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders .	52.08596
never rebuilt , the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic .	35.62082
during the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior .	22.64033
union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams .	29.348066
but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when brigadier general william e . ( grumble ) jones reached philippi while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may , 1863 .	46.032455
general jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it .	45.200645
reverend joshual corder , a baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies , to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure	50.782608
he reasoned and argued , pointing out that jones or other confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat .	144.32352
jones relented , he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the confederate army , while jones and his raiders turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden .	56.086014
again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing confederate force .	99.82178
on the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose .	44.297054
centering around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events , beginning on may 28th and continuing through june 3rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi .	44.406906
it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years .	75.86595
we have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there .	27.312212
we have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy .	24.14093
we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds .	76.09631
true , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions .	51.269455
but problems cling to pools , as any pool owner knows .	154.39821
so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience .	97.70438
position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and/or physical .	163.13751
one of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house .	61.07971
the other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill .	85.43573
if you are dreaming of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys .	53.276535
you are likely to be nearer the truth .	7.8499455
you can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let ' s-make-your-house-our-club attitude .	68.63445
on the other hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool .	53.37129
another dilemma as picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool .	30.112444
yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed .	19.761019
as in choosing a wife , it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good .	73.54496
in the colder climes , for instance , you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best .	48.269012
it may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs .	44.035336
even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold .	69.97526
( we do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool .	34.174744
probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts .	60.737637
naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land .	17.297283
but if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day , it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house .	43.402893
and a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement .	57.35509
the placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety .	96.55227
coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet .	78.3419
eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master ' s delectation .	49.83073
but not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies .	49.545994
we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards .	31.861134
our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled .	12.138152
had we taken a lien on a state park ? ?	81.35213
we had merely been discovered by the pool sharks .	3.4730835
from proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks .	64.15137
naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool ' ' were both unexpected and unsettling .	66.403114
after the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result .	60.140587
so rules we made , in unabashed collusion .	5.3968744
since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners .	37.78403
first and foremost no one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle .	151.76411
just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view .	25.95124
their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times .	78.58285
no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand .	13.085856
no ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees .	3.8886106
we want to know when the potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won ' t end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august .	46.308037
no young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party .	68.12408
and accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities .	31.394361
a gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard .	36.860027
no bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run .	48.186775
( sanity , solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop .	129.88657
we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours .	125.39241
this has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate ' ' than ours .	71.470634
we also worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille .	69.01257
we gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides .	32.77429
all dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers ' homes .	58.670193
( to avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area .	39.529087
) we do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences .	39.159565
life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young .	47.544014
safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together .	61.84147
in many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet .	50.16959
but fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay .	26.517279
we allow no underwater endurance contests , either , or inexpert versions of water polo .	24.577394
diving boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly , but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ) .	59.929775
and divers must be enjoined to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge .	69.50272
our pools also have wide , shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords .	45.0733
all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups .	16.780697
when you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent .	36.310616
you should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits .	34.013397
soignee pools , alas , do not just happen .	22.937891
they are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements .	87.18222
unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool ' s pristine purity , its care and feeding -- from ph content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service .	44.23214
of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) .	33.21025
or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers .	22.916216
even so , every pool owner , in case of emergency , should have some idea of what makes things work .	97.38177
a brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis .	44.481853
a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight .	65.217705
with or without professional help , you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse .	24.376238
you should see to it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in front of the filter , is always clean .	15.782331
a pool is no place for a shut trap .	10.745547
you should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water .	44.82151
you can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing .	49.894554
many hours of spring cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall .	35.840317
as the pool is emptied , stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet .	91.41713
much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry .	58.773346
if you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe , you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out .	41.324146
of course , when your 6-inch torrent of water is released , it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties .	77.59259
if your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris .	40.099
it may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around .	149.9037
once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present .	70.44144
often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense .	113.67003
our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes .	93.14734
follow pool-care instructions to the letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claiming , `` it wasn ' t my turn ' ' .	32.530502
never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship .	112.4711
you may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in .	126.845985
draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania .	30.30991
any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years .	27.888607
fortunately , it is the fha which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress .	71.464424
even if you live above that line , the fha will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged .	51.762737
new simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 .	25.371944
two men can often do the installation in a day .	83.106155
you can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house .	37.64936
no less an authority than the fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs .	51.914314
home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted .	32.62977
we know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want .	112.16529
we know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling .	105.65697
on the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills .	39.996452
the filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever .	4.0137553
control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid .	27.671597
heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat .	186.48149
the cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine .	21.37123
the need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent .	29.841293
clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words .	252.00932
when you ' re less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter .	321.1154
the children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms .	57.001957
you ' ll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves .	39.486652
you can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around .	82.51798
best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford .	62.32219
like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more .	45.76257
that brings its per-year cost down mighty low .	4.745138
no matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed .	31.296782
the equipment won ' t take up valuable space either .	85.83955
but there ' s no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year- ' round whole-house air conditioning is when you build .	37.896233
if that ' s done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself .	76.41549
if you can ' t see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later .	432.6564
manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial .	77.366516
if your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it .	78.7685
this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling .	16.438042
you can get year- ' round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow .	72.23536
the units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area .	15.202959
the cooling coil is located in the furnace ' s outlet .	29.815626
from the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement .	15.176103
if you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for .	59.27879
be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed .	35.89005
be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling .	12.619059
this is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone .	7.3187857
be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating .	42.965633
you can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house .	72.42985
for cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water .	23.14169
instead of radiators you ' ll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat .	39.83942
these systems are more expensive than year- ' round forced air systems .	258.75964
the minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone .	34.823685
if the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system .	17.592546
the simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit .	11.485768
it is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted .	22.526974
in a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone .	73.36989
in a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second .	23.708998
in each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control .	65.96763
one of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating .	103.34835
as you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors .	51.44761
a relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors .	41.00384
up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees .	63.857674
now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees .	48.98357
you can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone .	47.10466
consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don ' t want to start up your whole heating plant .	31.33351
how large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors .	30.102142
among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family .	57.69764
families with children usually don ' t want the house quite so cool .	177.51144
if you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity .	464.52084
the body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load .	198.06696
cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of aj .	64.60283
a btu is a unit of heat , and the btu rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour .	39.8945
a very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you ' ll need 15 btu ' s of cooling for every square foot of your house .	68.578995
this is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees .	8.86673
you ' ll need more if the high average is above that , less if it ' s below .	105.627045
a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice .	93.9096
by accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12 , 000 btu of cooling in one hour .	37.282864
you may find a conditioner rated by horsepower .	2.6371884
it is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you ' ll get .	48.77304
a 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8 , 000 btu to well over 10 , 000 aj .	39.838802
the safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself .	46.629944
don ' t urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough .	54.493305
better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big .	200.11371
reducing humidity is often as important as cooling .	4.0505786
an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period .	56.544044
before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low .	110.37
with a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature .	54.30492
attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately .	119.72337
a well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month .	32.240593
if you have a house which heat doesn ' t penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove .	57.212723
keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you ' ve won the first battle .	31.33294
in a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution .	49.18606
if the house you plan to buy or build won ' t have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings .	47.31373
shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can .	174.09386
drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house .	35.301292
the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact .	100.25568
the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you ' re going to need .	136.90448
a shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money .	41.063038
you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation .	41.55049
restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house .	29.903482
an attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool .	17.947248
you ' ll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one .	70.52533
insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum .	407.59964
in insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 .	2.5877972
they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors .	22.75065
such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling .	37.243237
a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent .	12.22136
it costs two to three times as much to remove a btu in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary btu is worth attention .	68.99296
you ' ll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier .	37.85686
it ' s no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum .	66.838715
good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you ' re doing your own contracting , don ' t award the job on the basis of price alone .	24.85596
most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning .	7.4596667
you must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are	61.588745
you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed .	94.566025
with such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .	25.708334
begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible .	77.86274
these are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies .	42.18797
the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site .	27.708975
these are inexpensive and available from the u . s . geological society , washington 25 , d . c . .	5.3223586
in recent years many counties and the u . s . forest service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use .	27.233482
most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor ' s office showing ownerships of land .	95.21083
inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation .	37.916603
this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons .	24.934582
it is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site .	33.66428
these are a great aid for planning use back at the office .	88.2864
for site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study .	52.574284
however , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation .	46.462296
county judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences .	57.43498
a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area .	164.83023
this , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision .	46.56452
it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone .	65.36098
usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions .	264.76068
a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water .	104.567635
the same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use .	138.29665
in looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others .	124.45706
how well can the site be developed ? ?	1.0153359
how useful will it be to the public ? ?	11.133704
check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site .	95.7635
naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes .	40.435642
frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water .	19.910114
some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests .	112.81077
one of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery .	157.98024
it may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees .	43.108368
a site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .	31.452183
an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach .	18.37075
a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs .	14.335292
note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy .	76.68788
water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .	62.951252
most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas .	119.99039
this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports .	29.025133
a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use .	49.438488
it also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life .	10.733379
the amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important .	23.107054
a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use .	38.479073
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer .	40.713623
if the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied .	28.06995
a stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area .	70.5149
other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .	35.88927
other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed .	19.45695
just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area .	200.03854
although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site .	102.90942
the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them .	134.84966
a group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .	63.617085
the fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest .	66.49428
fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission .	59.90332
animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .	27.314432
the site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life .	30.892668
clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas .	82.41783
each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done .	64.26131
park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in .	62.09014
the historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered .	143.60402
notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth ' s crust in your region .	21.9905
those which tell a story of the earth ' s formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .	25.182417
an old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest .	33.559483
some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera .	13.9236965
how well can the site be developed ? ?	1.0153359
look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites .	56.764374
-- the size of the area alone can be a determining factor .	21.54204
an area may be too small for the needs of the project .	27.8222
areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments .	67.65145
acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones .	67.60299
shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development .	54.420776
a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide .	68.78779
this is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions .	36.795288
however , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman ' s trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit .	61.832092
-- the values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there .	27.759089
for instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not .	60.37917
the utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site .	45.809444
check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil .	15.642665
nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera .	9.481384
determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .	105.0418
-- in addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation .	19.555515
the quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection .	45.37113
the area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines .	124.25337

your invitation to write about serge prokofieff to honor his 70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because i admire the music of prokofieff	36.336422
and with sober purpose , because the development of prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the union of soviet socialist republics .	19.334364
the serge prokofieff whom we knew in the united states of america was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician .	33.24499
these qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-world war 1 , era .	17.462671
prokofieff ' s outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in america was , indeed , brilliant .	94.70072
prokofieff ' s classical symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties .	56.73918
to the traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism	14.619101
to the neo-classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world .	13.90915
a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times	21.659506
certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .	28.20475
i heard the classical symphony for the first time when koussevitzky conducted it in paris in 1927 .	41.855816
i myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) .	7.9696507
i remember ernest bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon dieu , can anyone take this music seriously ' ' ? ?	41.2443
the answer is , `` yes ' ' ! !	15.362758
certainly , america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure .	45.32434
his life-long friend , serge koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in boston , new york , and washington , d . c . , , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation .	24.529577
chicago was also a welcome host there , in 1921 , prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the love for three oranges , and played the first performance of his third piano concerto .	43.985516
`` uncle sam ' ' was , indeed , a rich uncle to prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure `` the golden twenties ' ' .	41.193043
we attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites	4.879911
we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches	12.086773
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .	73.832985
we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth-century composers .	41.23097
nevertheless , prokofieff was much influenced by paris during the twenties the paris which was the artistic center of the western world -- the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich america -- the avant-garde paris of diaghileff , stravinsky , koussevitzky , cocteau , picasso -- the laissez-faire paris of dadaism and ultramodern art -- the paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .	22.331911
so young prokofieff was the darling of success in his motherland	7.6766186
in the spacious hunting grounds of `` uncle sam ' '	5.3993506
in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .	52.46616
meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .	10.9223995
in this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , prokofieff was recalled to his native land .	40.315395
the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom-loving peoples of the capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist tyranny into cringing submission .	23.27832
after this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men	36.022186
a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure .	46.112564
in this changed world , prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose .	117.348724
here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world .	58.20504
here , prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism -- producing music for the masses .	76.13965
it is at this point in his life that the mature prokofieff emerges .	34.565132
one might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .	54.51269
he accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise .	45.273804
by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people `` i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody .	31.100128
this is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new , not old ' ' .	44.651306
how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .	60.578526
and with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music .	88.03807
compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little classical symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent fifth symphony	38.456734
or the love for three oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , the stone flower .	50.52437
this masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people earthy , salty and humorous .	18.985155
of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .	104.05404
the early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience	370.22473
the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .	28.346205
however , in all of prokofieff ' s music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` signature ' ' -- his craftsman ' s attitude .	52.20464
prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .	12.188372
in orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color .	65.11311
his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .	6.4362917
his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .	25.911438
his counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .	117.293846
also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required .	46.463673
that prokofieff ' s harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original ' ' than we prefer to believe .	81.56623
need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability .	18.938177
prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated .	40.876354
at this date , it seems probable that the name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history , as an effective traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose	41.948612
yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics .	47.94409
certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the western world -- not his experimentations .	31.186876
so prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them .	33.64507
nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .	34.766136
his fellow-countryman , igor stravinsky , certainly did not .	22.120762
why did prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? ?	31.970427
i think the answer is to be found in prokofieff ' s own words `` the clarity must be new , not old ' ' .	61.49217
when prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose ' ' , he shaped his talents to his purpose .	17.541761
when stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures .	22.857426
prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas .	58.73785
but stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting .	69.69159
in all his miscalculations , stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments .	39.243282
because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant petruchka , his savage sacre du printemps , his incisive les noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed .	28.747574
but time is running out , and many of stravinsky ' s admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma .	27.080105
his various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself supra-expressionism , neo-paganism , neo-classicism , neo-romanticism , neo-jazz , neo-ecclesiasticism , neo-popularism , and most recently , post-serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ! !	35.04226
what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! !	1.1172913
meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist	73.69506
a maladroit reharmonization of our national anthem ( the star-spangled banner )	3.2360332
a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto	75.25385
his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular american commercial songs ! !	77.21236
stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home .	50.637043
prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .	64.85069
in the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose .	79.466286
with a large and circumspect 20th-century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children ' s fairy tales -- slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large .	49.5446
of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him	48.34112
it must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose .	93.1911
thus in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced one of the great composers of the twentieth century .	15.430415
that his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it .	93.2147
that he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture	32.76914
and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-century evidence of the effectiveness of evolution , based on a broad traditionalism for the creative art of music .	41.944324
april 10 marked a memorable date in new york ' s musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states .	22.645163
on that date the musicians emergency fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30th anniversary .	42.533005
roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell cotman .	25.008871
and like this english master , mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them .	77.722496
as a boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods .	47.831005
his father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature .	45.45254
out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that roy first painted subjects he knew best hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape .	52.023083
it is this subject matter that has brought mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors .	64.981445
mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .	34.274654
like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures .	85.66409
but it did teach roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia .	35.159992
on the death of their father , they returned to their home in batavia , new york .	14.355197
after more years of concentrated effort , roy and his brother max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand .	67.218704
during all this time roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods .	67.03242
gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions .	36.229176
but even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ! !	47.18569
except for a rich friendship with the painter , chauncey ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- roy developed his art by himself .	98.93408
in the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint .	46.940083
he worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium .	91.41813
gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique .	178.47911
it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of batavia .	11.191645
more often than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .	84.07155
what i have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form	77.34314
color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition	28.761595
and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the mason stylemark .	26.001295
finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .	36.801178
but for the technical fact , we have the artist ' s own testimony	46.358143
`` of late years , i find that i like best to work out-of-doors .	89.087814
first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately af inches ) in which i pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns .	86.01533
if a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , i try to place them in the initial sketch .	66.21161
for me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose .	45.89673
`` i am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him	111.17545
as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .	64.96441
just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition .	41.839615
if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result .	63.078957
out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which i call clicking .	55.50649
`` speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition .	52.718956
`` if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , i mean to project equal concern for color .	50.973145
often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .	52.63228
when this occurs , i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if i have been working on a full sheet in the field .	31.646612
`` when working from one of my sketches i square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal .	77.22013
when this linear draft is completed , i dust it down to a faint image .	39.235348
from this point , i paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage .	90.3738
however , first i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines i have described .	78.39717
then i plan my attack the parts i will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .	66.2399
the longer i work , the more i am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important .	36.598686
trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .	113.343925
`` as for materials , i use the best available .	23.322021
i work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain .	51.390514
in my studio i work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes .	59.748817
i have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an english make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight .	99.51434
after selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water .	66.845764
then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board .	53.371075
`` in addition to the usual tools , i make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes .	46.235123
the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist .	36.435112
i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio .	42.338852
`` my brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for i combine the sable and the bristle .	25.07441
and a very large , flat wash brush .	5.3090115
the bristles are a fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge .	10.8661375
`` my usual palette consists of top-quality colors alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , french ultramarine blue , winsor green , hooker ' s green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , payne ' s gray , charcoal gray , davy ' s gray , and ivory black ' ' .	9.334803
in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here .	96.638596
true , a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory .	50.704792
unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist ' s pictures are full of atmosphere and climate .	54.191128
long observation has taught mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights	104.55787
and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky .	3.9026604
in following this general principle , mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .	27.674288
when painting , mason ' s physical eyes are half-closed , while his mind ' s eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .	59.815178
he does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject	175.60492
rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .	27.882616
it is for this reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment .	157.6943
his pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale	45.609478
they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people .	43.414757
by dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , roy mason has found a particular niche in american landscape art .	26.032948
living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all .	53.077435
the artist was born in gilbert mills , new york , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to california , he lived in western new york , in batavia .	29.964622
when i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march 15th , i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist the water sign of pisces ( february 18 thru march 20 ) .	58.35461
and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again , in his natal month of march ! !	68.44769
over the years , beginning in 1929 , mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals	113.125084
the blair purchase prize for watercolor , art institute of chicago	108.70038
and others in buffalo , new york , chautauqua , new haven , rochester , rockport , and most recently , the $300 prize for a watercolor at the laguna beach art association ,	14.4466715
he was elected to the national academy of design as an associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first ranger fund purchase prize at the academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to academicianship in 1940 .	49.53122
other memberships include the american watercolor society , philadelphia water color club , allied artists of america , audubon artists , baltimore watercolor society .	120.400925
the russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the american gymnasts in the 1960 olympics for one reason -- they were better .	32.98231
they were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers .	89.34276
our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance .	78.06171
the russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .	26.455198
after all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics competition .	17.86777
but if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ?	26.179613
it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .	63.194717
taking first things first , let ' s understand the sport called gymnastics .	81.264046
it is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work .	17.475372
the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in american gyms , but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games .	41.519478
the parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .	14.279039
but the russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance .	100.43468
the gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .	21.826256
in short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well .	28.280617
the addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen .	127.42645
another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .	64.14772
( an enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days .	49.804504
most europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries .	12.102944
) in most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him .	49.35214
the american is very lucky if he has three .	567.4203
if a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools .	94.65309
first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both .	83.51139
oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty .	130.90341
certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .	54.231697
russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800 , 000 competing for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team .	32.456047
eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself .	54.72237
we could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .	46.40639
and what has dancing to do with all this ? ?	31.332373
russia ' s young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus .	32.248352
well-stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic contest .	32.873863
american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons .	6.295661
they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace .	31.648428
they were further stripped of old wive ' s tales by seeing the slender , lovely russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle .	34.92988
president kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation .	111.171906
if we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it .	43.619743
to be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance .	172.30707
if the dance teachers of america make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead .	143.95827
school teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators .	67.66665
there should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it .	76.739746
they should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .	243.37097
dance teachers can respond to president kennedy ' s request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility .	66.1255
very little in today ' s living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility .	194.0836
they often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength .	37.5209
ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing .	68.78418
even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas .	22.760746
this isn ' t surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in america cannot chin themselves once , and that english school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) .	66.0221
the only area in which american boys hold their own is the baseball throw .	47.950233
for arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended .	104.44038
it should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side .	59.59272
those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it .	140.20387
those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down .	36.95002
when they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up .	34.64562
parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .	35.531487
arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the horse kick .	41.972885
keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm .	57.55613
after this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher .	46.69915
follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible .	47.352394
push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first .	99.393456
start on the knees in a large circle .	4.830759
fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor .	23.45155
do this exercise six times each class period .	7.401945
as strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward .	27.805384
start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out .	34.232334
try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands .	44.04208
the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide .	62.13439
let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down .	66.60052
five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .	108.630066
handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength .	50.203175
of course those who have developed more will find them easier .	172.96529
start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle .	60.134594
at first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help .	112.66208
drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back .	44.74106
the right will land first , followed by the left .	40.021923
care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible .	58.02345
this will prevent flat falls and toe injuries .	1.8742552
bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper .	34.132015
eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg .	128.7112
the child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles .	52.036434
be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time .	54.17834
the backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results .	51.082874
have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent .	19.411133
place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders .	51.244137
arch the back upwards to make a bridge .	8.971394
be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling .	49.93279
as flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher .	128.0389
later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .	16.205023
to further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle .	21.924845
place the hands in front of the chest .	2.7003381
keep the legs straight and the toes pointed .	6.5238113
straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back .	33.35852
at the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head .	50.44215
improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .	11.104277
the last essential to the beginner ' s gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll .	42.5412
this used to be part of every child ' s bag of tricks , but few children can do it today	57.85967
some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright .	142.66827
for most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can .	63.16001
after it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) .	59.076775
he places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest .	18.521788
he then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over .	49.874718
one or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo .	25.511255
if , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed .	54.554626
when the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis	54.13031
then no matter what happens , the child ' s performance will be controlled .	25.271456
by lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded .	37.755596
these are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) .	60.78944
even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity .	41.331192
it is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative .	40.389103
and dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more .	83.45673
every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics .	68.131714
we have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry .	66.08831
the host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality .	50.59998
when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering .	24.05035
the author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities .	50.829033
the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .	103.88661
we use the term `` bio-medicine ' ' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .	24.073963
electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine .	22.56565
recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis .	9.965651
commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices .	30.961166
in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow ' s commonplace equipment originates .	48.234695
from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research .	50.94229
many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation .	19.929144
this stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside .	234.3244
a completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-tv system to view the results .	35.588104
fig . 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical electronics center of rockefeller institute .	25.244682
by combining the talents of a medical man , dr . aterman , a biophysicist , mr . berkely , and an electronics expert , dr . zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes .	28.663471
three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources .	25.147
these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror	11.215357
instead of the observer ' s eye the image orthicon in the tv camera does the `` looking ' ' .	43.10017
the microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz .	41.15566
the video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen .	48.749535
( note because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor .	14.798996
this assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry .	12.719938
) this is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-tv system which preceded the present simultaneous system .	17.826996
three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube .	5.278115
the result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths .	34.742855
many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum .	17.039892
different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .	55.457127
where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail .	104.520134
at the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .	40.992416
the medical title of `` lobar ventilation in man ' ' by drs . c . j . martin and a . c . young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process .	30.381159
at the university of washington medical school , the electronics group has developed the `` respiratory gas analyzer ' ' shown in fig . 3 .	29.499327
this unit , affectionately dubbed `` the monster ' ' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient ' s breathing .	32.688744
in the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other .	18.916862
usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position .	62.02889
from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .	47.647984
the original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today ' s techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat .	33.944412
for many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed .	19.812956
a group of researchers at the university of washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques .	102.297455
one simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched .	63.52378
a balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .	89.58362
sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .	33.52957
the travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second	31.559412
thus it takes about 16 msec . to traverse 25 mm . of tissue .	10.54877
a sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation .	36.103104
in addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .	69.11473
the doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel .	20.98269
a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself .	18.001438
it uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream .	9.76612
the latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow .	11.817997
it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart ' s left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself .	15.990474
this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made .	21.517145
a simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in fig . 2 .	12.3385725
outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder .	18.870457
from this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power .	145.85696
several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers .	49.627377
this original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm . in diameter .	14.705681
battery life limited the use of this `` pill ' ' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .	44.82092
a refinement of this technique has been described by drs . zworykin and farrar and mr . berkely of the medical electronics center of the rockefeller institute .	8.466781
in this novel arrangement the `` pill ' ' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer .	23.114267
as shown in fig . 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc . bursts .	40.363277
the energy received by the `` pill ' ' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring ' ' on after the burst and this `` ringing ' ' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill ' ' .	19.54259
these frequencies are amplified and detected by the fm receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill ' ' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .	29.0077
one of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill ' ' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .	25.069675
applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .	90.14672
one of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body .	23.356043
our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects .	75.40982
various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water .	41.148987
in medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar .	38.31623
because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels .	71.0603
bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals .	13.480332
based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through ' ' human organs .	76.00971
a good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by dr . g . baum who has explored the human eye .	24.12223
he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .	105.194626
the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in fig . 6 .	11.9289465
the transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown .	46.556873
for display , dr . baum uses a portion of an af , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record .	22.47325
a typical `` sonogram ' ' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in fig . 5 .	35.141857
the frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc . and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter .	17.420443
the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into ' ' all corners .	41.856167
the total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period .	28.851833
drs . howry and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results .	72.140076
by submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in fig . 7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights .	30.849
as mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in fig . 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .	30.961351
arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls .	111.95615
a cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in fig . 8 with the various parts labeled .	29.770905
oersted ' s boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life .	98.23868
he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on the island of langeland in the south-central part of denmark on august 14 , 1777 .	10.278757
his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school .	91.9632
the two older boys , hans and anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german	77.28345
his wife taught the two boys to read and write danish .	33.77307
other brothers later joined them for instruction with oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to bible reading , german , and danish in the informal curriculum .	21.80959
oldenburg ' s contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town ' s learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .	51.140465
from the town surveyor , hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects .	56.69334
the mayor of the town taught them english and french .	25.522316
whatever hans or anders learned separately they passed on to each other	50.016636
they read every book that they could borrow in the village .	32.189247
at 12 , hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science .	42.582073
his earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .	51.18096
in 1793 the brothers decided to enter the university of copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session .	33.201004
while hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law .	31.998055
the brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt .	37.052036
they supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could .	39.033134
so impressive were those serious years of study at the university that hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination	46.194157
there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society .	66.83502
i lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error ' ' .	35.80085
he openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science .	25.709278
in this third year at the university , hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` limits of poetry and prose ' ' .	33.33214
he completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine .	48.056534
he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices .	235.16234
hans ' student days were at a time when europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america and in france , germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the continent .	43.176907
the new century opened with oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .	25.042517
he was stirred by the announcement of volta ' s discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis .	34.84131
the following year he devoted to the customary `` wanderjahr ' ' , traveling in germany , france , and the netherlands , meeting the philosophers schelling , fichte , and tieck .	12.737032
he also met count rumford ( born benjamin thompson in woburn , mass . ) who was then serving the elector of bavaria , and the physicist ritter	17.133982
these were oersted ' s main contacts in science .	426.4606
from gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` the first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .	37.2071
as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes i have invented , i have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in copenhagen i used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me ' ' .	73.5182
oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left .	199.51518
with ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host ' s fertile but disorganized mind .	37.818855
oersted remodeled ritter ' s notes into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france for its annual prize of 3 , 000 francs .	24.716478
the sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him .	61.145164
in may , 1803 , ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy .	56.010967
he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries .	28.926718
thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` leiden ' ' jar by kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile .	12.109905
ritter proceeded , `` you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon .	32.05229
ritter died in 1810 and oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it .	61.335144
in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for the university ' s chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist .	32.99536
however , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in german and danish periodicals .	27.983297
in 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 .	25.04349
during oersted ' s attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences .	40.828075
he was , however , fortunate in his contact with prof . j . g . l . manthey ( 1769-1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` lion pharmacy ' ' in copenhagen where oersted assisted him .	20.81471
manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted ' s disposal during and after his graduation .	47.06141
in 1800 , manthey went abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy .	17.919756
in february 1801 , oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead .	48.24835
in the following year , 1803 , oersted , simultaneously with davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts .	41.578506
eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing ' ' .	27.422543
he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood .	73.16199
the university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .	69.453094
his broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him .	85.98875
his friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .	55.23257
the years 1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again , but on this visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey .	56.464264
in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in german and this was issued in french translation ( paris , 1813 ) under the title recherches sur l ' identite des forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists .	32.316685
his interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated .	37.713352
chapter 8 , is entitled `` on magnetism ' ' and in it are included such remarks as , `` one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces .	40.599224
the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison .	87.504326
it is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication	207.68924
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference .	63.465107
the form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form .	46.032818
there , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism .	46.372566
but in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it .	78.30033
one could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do .	195.5137
it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by bruckmann and coulomb .	33.336647
by that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces .	67.724464
an attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such ' ' .	59.76312
oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions .	26.267982
in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship .	87.19141
he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current .	30.495632
in 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm , one of the danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition .	18.46574
it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , lauritz esmarch , that oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow .	34.221912
together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents .	19.576502
esmarch was among those who witnessed oersted ' s first demonstration of his discovery .	18.731466
the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades .	28.181976
electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles .	35.260593
in the late 1700 ' s beccaria and van marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it .	49.48904
beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic .	22.304533
the resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise .	13.231721
the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces .	58.35408
oersted ' s own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it .	69.904625
the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of oersted ' s discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 .	48.570927
at this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .	44.009182

there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle ( 1 ) fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons	32.29133
( 2 ) mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface	116.572945
( 3 ) special bunks -- as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides .	70.74881
several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk .	24.090597
the selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference .	88.98753
no one material is best for all situations .	3.1956627
selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem .	14.3856735
animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk .	18.088749
these bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence .	131.16359
because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal .	24.806065
filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations .	77.17967
all-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year .	413.4297
this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall .	244.36185
marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs . .	59.279327
companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged r & d facilities , faster new product development .	64.91347
many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge .	150.12451
given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs . ? ?	43.45585
based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .	115.13608
there has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years	17.143732
frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers .	15.495949
despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer .	170.76434
here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target	101.33739
has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? ?	79.34705
have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? ?	41.031303
have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? ?	83.0231
average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions .	43.84044
this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses .	46.305096
have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? ?	14.701772
need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties .	16.515484
first , most products tend to become more complex .	15.166278
second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around .	102.985504
providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product .	128.39961
too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction .	138.59888
good service starts with product design and planning many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one .	105.32463
proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations .	60.740936
have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ?	127.43551
in spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions .	43.436394
to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important .	46.26282
your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products .	58.74962
many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer ' s dollar being spent on their particular products .	58.87407
has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying ' ' area ? ?	29.054726
the trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the southwest and far west , and from city to suburbs .	80.404236
these shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs . .	4.109026
have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? ?	67.328995
we have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends .	77.83761
instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts .	91.16926
the change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted .	34.41462
have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? ?	71.34315
in the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade .	27.33176
as mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer ' s as well as the distributor ' s profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .	38.224285
average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded .	23.348717
moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on .	82.26231
if you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? ?	47.9455
if private brand competition hasn ' t been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? ?	141.48358
display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties .	22.116665
it has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .	14.8852
how can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? ?	48.71226
if you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? ?	90.93069
salesmanship is still necessary , but it ' s a different brand of salesmanship .	7.8727107
have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? ?	175.18724
have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ? ?	54.709873
are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? ?	18.598356
some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes .	39.458042
no manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved .	101.88907
the use of bulk handling is continuously growing .	4.6384053
computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels .	45.366257
`` selective selling ' ' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers .	63.87485
there may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain .	34.93909
do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ?	78.76066
in your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? ?	36.96732
will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? ?	81.50725
in one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos . .	134.65182
as a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved .	112.15181
distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .	81.45025
from the manufacturer ' s point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties .	28.041
it is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods , and private label competition .	37.528652
how much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ?	28.973694
are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? ?	57.048016
have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ?	32.586563
practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon .	5.12279
will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products ? ?	64.55892
if competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store .	65.54153
on the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive .	111.40338
as markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger .	123.12739
is your r & d or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? ?	35.43585
are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with r & d people ? ?	66.89381
technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it ' s useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register .	50.06535
are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization	35.066288
who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs	16.386038
and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ?	256.91583
we have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn ' t make up its mind .	107.66101
in the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .	47.609627
while many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training .	178.4312
nor has the training been enough in relation to the need .	22.191133
most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements .	70.09802
have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? ?	29.180838
has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs . ? ?	16.745447
with the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today -- and it will be tougher in the future .	59.850243
men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work .	91.70852
the growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .	16.431093
does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? ?	44.16262
does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? ?	46.688137
every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning .	133.23941
`` hip-pocket ' ' tactics are going to be harder to apply .	29.864594
many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis .	61.82626
with greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can ' t switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically .	101.833115
are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? ?	24.283821
we find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning .	35.812504
are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? ?	43.8877
do you have a long-term ( 5- or 10-yr . ) marketing program ? ?	27.372486
the key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company ' s marketing problems realistically .	30.355774
solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management .	35.333683
if companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade .	97.59138
the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion .	62.462257
the architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building .	34.730785
ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education .	94.92646
it is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .	206.45578
the element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure .	41.508896
this would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer ' s training .	36.96048
we may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject .	94.0244
the real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? ?	143.45953
the american institute of interior designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course .	51.821728
an examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the national association of schools of art , and a further `` on the spot ' ' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .	38.589935
one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .	79.13946
the suggested course of the a . i . d . was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities .	54.834217
obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated .	128.72961
without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer .	32.006554
to begin with , what is an interior designer ? ?	4.3637424
`` the dictionary of occupational titles ' ' published by the u . s . department of labor describes him as follows `` designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television .	32.368877
makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes .	17.913122
makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project ' ' .	23.766886
in addition to this the u . s . civil service bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them .	93.13428
he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings ' ' .	29.684004
the interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance .	67.86961
yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it .	164.99066
and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .	38.892227
few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum .	34.177704
it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .	74.51801
the old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations .	14.057282
as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- `` design a luxury apartment ' '	278.57275
no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply `` a luxury apartment ' ' .	58.666447
working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .	109.71347
it is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel ' ' of real interior design demands .	92.80964
unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .	58.43703
it is like medical schools in india where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon .	30.612207
instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .	12.226828
thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .	33.743412
in the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use .	40.47182
but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .	10.790255
consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work .	73.796555
fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade ' ' .	76.15344
even the `` history of furniture ' ' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .	30.570715
here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced .	57.746693
the professional organizations such as american institute of interior designers , national society of interior designers , home fashions league and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .	63.061752
certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .	39.193237
not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject .	47.511597
participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership .	63.664154
the largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .	44.419518
this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students .	37.313427
the professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .	67.42757
this seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .	50.17965
in one way the institutes and societies do a disservice to the schools .	19.09249
that is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses ' ' in their membership requirements .	24.534513
when these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .	70.277985
long hard years of `` on the job ' ' training had brought them to their competence .	43.907375
the necessity of that day has long disappeared .	4.350993
there is plenty of opportunity for proper education today .	78.42543
it is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .	22.033653
the reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses ' ' has long since passed .	34.117466
no one can deny that these `` back door ' ' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .	54.236107
beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves .	85.079475
it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students .	102.463005
the local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .	113.317505
nor will the hack , the jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice .	117.33602
only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .	57.815712
at the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art ' ' .	64.9781
this kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .	51.420994
we must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres .	53.76136
considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .	52.017258
in all `` degree ' ' courses in interior design a number of `` academic ' ' or `` general studies ' ' courses are included .	21.272293
it is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in english , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects .	123.739456
the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .	191.08957
the matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .	95.1227
one technical question of school organization comes to mind here .	77.79364
for proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate .	74.8638
since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed .	160.37872
indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all .	60.78286
the question , however , cannot be ignored for long .	137.51968
the basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree .	113.12772
most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers .	114.086784
one solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .	59.103485
it is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it .	79.078575
this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general .	70.53659
only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations .	120.10694
it has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department .	96.076385
this , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design .	62.948944
in spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject .	133.6856
there will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` national association of schools of art ' ' .	127.33978
independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .	68.24889

consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program .	77.37073
too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant .	103.374535
but even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider .	37.871952
in what section of the country are you located ? ?	45.256763
are you in a rural or urban area ? ?	7.9179497
these factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program .	74.84781
above all , don ' t set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will .	109.35445
unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time .	62.995934
some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere .	108.7683
if you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they ' re entitled to .	77.411354
this can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers ' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command .	103.642685
hallmark cards , inc . , kansas city , mo . , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` benefit bafflers ' ' , which it distributes to employees .	17.134369
m & r dietetic laboratories , inc . , columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe .	107.51562
u . s . rubber company , new york , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits .	49.227417
the blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for example , costs $227 . 72 .	26.76325
have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically .	48.527958
you may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions .	35.68542
check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .	76.96523
it can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .	75.22733
also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field .	8.012243
this will mean that every time there ' s an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner .	97.114204
don ' t go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .	81.06651
generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement .	171.14053
in granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker ' s relation to the deceased must be to qualify .	42.911556
thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin ' s funeral .	45.79817
also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you ' ll probably never use it .	92.477516
coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .	56.693504
vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .	98.63069
if coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group .	180.74571
consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas .	2.1706188
make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee .	13.713369
otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers .	39.731922
keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company .	30.160885
and so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .	38.992264
make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan .	103.91441
younger men usually don ' t think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they ' re liable to change jobs several times before settling down .	114.14132
choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans .	3.0162945
there are two sides of a coin for this decision .	38.040054
workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to .	115.9297
and they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company .	162.6785
a non-contributory plan usually won ' t pay off for the worker until he retires .	33.336864
thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .	37.509354
make sure you don ' t pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working .	69.48046
these include leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs .	4.868945
consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant .	77.97223
it ' s usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods .	129.42455
for example , the friday after thanksgiving can be substituted for washington ' s birthday .	24.830318
this reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups .	4.3978586
require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .	75.046936
consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .	3.4431512
latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you .	26.697647
if a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price .	137.07202
if the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won ' t blame the concessionaire .	24.933743
check your cafeteria location to make sure it ' s convenient for most employees .	67.38183
you may save valuable production minutes with a change .	210.88734
spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks .	93.61006
this will cut the expense of vacation replacements .	1.6206806
and with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .	141.21358
also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation .	180.9827
you might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year .	39.744152
the long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era .	50.61738
modern times have changed the world beyond recognition .	3.957637
the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away .	46.910805
but with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing .	96.01209
as the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports .	19.264595
sporting firearms change , markedly for the better .	66.03501
just as modern transportation has outmoded the early studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today ' s sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment .	39.144726
the american firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms .	36.88548
and millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today ' s hunting and target shooting .	32.76792
and due to modern resource-use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water .	59.795757
present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped .	25.688433
unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year .	57.396454
close to two million game birds were harvested on 1 , 500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on state game commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season .	42.662975
the shooting development program of the sporting arms and ammunition manufacturers ' institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers .	68.19379
the most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves .	56.369488
this has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the new york staff of the sportsmen ' s service bureau , and the saami shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .	18.785233
following the kick-off of saami ' s shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in washington , d . c . .	19.018137
the group known as the american association for health , , physical education , and recreation ( a division of the national education association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the national rifle association , saami and the american fishing tackle manufacturers .	40.64793
this meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the outdoor education project .	80.93214
the outdoor education project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .	114.360374
the various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development .	47.645874
but with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average american man or woman .	78.0808
following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by oep director dr . julian smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs .	72.86835
saami ' s financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .	16.124249
personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to outdoor education .	30.766851
considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .	92.37109
in 1959 saami ' s shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .	90.70069
this program is now nationally known as `` teen hunter clubs ' ' .	4.2949767
teen hunter clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the allied merchandising corporation .	18.499638
the first program was sponsored by abraham & strauss , hempstead , new york , under the direction of special events director jennings dennis .	25.339857
other pilot programs were conducted by a & s , babylon , new york	10.823341
other thc activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-tv stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources .	35.530987
saami ' s field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 teen hunter club activities which have reached over 40 , 000 enthusiastic young americans .	75.40914
through the efforts of saami ' s shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few .	36.553654
the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .	67.14563
while individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .	97.24363
help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level .	9.479395
the american gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association .	76.85675
since saami ' s conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the shooting development program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults .	30.481356
we trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment .	40.43993
are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? ?	10.599114
are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of american boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional american way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine american gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? ?	53.385914
is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? ?	6.0213747
would you like to organize teen hunters clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ? ?	73.59709
we were camping a few weeks ago on cape hatteras campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on north carolina ' s famed outer banks .	27.08793
this beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use .	291.99268
with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which americans are camping now .	126.05359
there were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , pop tents , baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .	13.020108
moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .	7.17634
we saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long national seashore recreation area .	20.581142
dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers .	56.612865
here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .	25.003332
almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets .	112.45228
you read various guesses on how many americans are camping .	6.505018
the number depends on who is talking at the moment .	13.133666
the figures range as high as 15 million families .	15.926499
i ' ve heard 10 million mentioned often , but i ' m more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping .	85.99391
seven million families would total 30 million americans or more .	82.24827
consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .	57.858704
harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with .	53.991955
they are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends .	114.59127
the national parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure .	64.30091
the national park service hopes by 1966 to have 30 , 000 campsites available for 100 , 000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present .	92.20066
the u . s . forest service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 national forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .	36.516937
they bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .	4.894062
they bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits .	36.22658
they come prepared for family fun because americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance .	67.05745
there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .	18.965422
among them , according to the u . s . department of commerce , are ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education .	58.63887
the more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn .	56.716564
camping is family fun , and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever saw before .	124.60599
but make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy .	170.86624
here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .	56.97956
the american automobile association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 .	89.02251
the aaa then splits it down this way $10 . 50 for meals , $9 . 50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous .	39.69826
what does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ?	167.83183
the $9 . 50 for lodging they save .	114.9733
because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10 . 50 food bill along with most of the tip money .	139.72015
the automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can ' t either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way .	71.71985
where americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have .	100.547
long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year .	63.135983
and even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces .	41.186707
it would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they ' re buying the comforts of home .	59.330112
home is the place to find the comforts of home .	16.532248
they ' re buying fun and adventure and family experiences .	55.959766
but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become .	171.89035
this is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy .	11.785861
today ' s campers want comforts , and they have them .	70.973236
and this helps explain why so many people are now going camping .	40.924244
it ' s fun , and it ' s easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families .	66.773605
neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags .	9.121341
neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .	42.6809
but there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .	97.82908
throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad .	156.08873
since the industrial revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed .	100.2814
there have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he didn ' t like it	33.892914
the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work	891.7138
and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions .	88.16604
there have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public ' s dissatisfaction and loss .	54.139267
this has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology .	61.338245
the remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash ' ' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates .	70.382385
but the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer .	58.672432
some men have no talent for or interest in management	56.29425
forcing them into management can only create trouble .	5.485322
the old shop adage still holds `` a good mechanic is usually a bad boss ' ' .	46.091858
yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success .	77.50173
labor fights to change its collar from blue to white .	32.167652
all grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .	32.30056
as several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world .	17.206583
what can be done for the `` individual contributor ' ' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? ?	26.02305
he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside	299.54575
usually concerned about america ' s belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles .	96.36779
yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title .	169.1188
even the college professor in america has been affected .	25.093336
it is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills .	72.250305
this difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course .	62.06057
this leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people ' ' .	37.750668
nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers .	34.6744
so we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` dual-road-up ' ' problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions .	43.058285
in the paragraphs that follow , we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page .	32.348827
among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of general electric .	86.52856
there is no one point in a man ' s career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward .	81.509735
further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path .	113.099846
it is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions .	33.39625
actually , there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide `` services ' ' operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities .	48.533886
also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man ' s recognition as a technical expert .	35.17632
as examples at ge glen b . warren , formerly manager of the turbine division , widely recognized as a turbine designer .	13.105642
the late w . r . g . baker , a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the electronics division , and later , by his own choice , an individual consultant .	35.857204
harold e . strang , expert in switchgear design , for a long period vp & gm of the measurements & industrial products division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is vice-president and consulting engineer in the switchgear & control division .	49.42493
in the ge plan , a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers .	80.014084
westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist .	51.762566
many companies have systems , particularly in r & d , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations .	63.54578
another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it `` that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach ' ' .	51.620453
one company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels .	59.258186
there is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks	2.5928056
the top non-supervisory level , senior staff engineer , enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision .	101.69555
the second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision .	16.75847
the expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level .	65.524185
the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers , but probably not into executive levels .	195.0432
in this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere .	87.10858
this reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military .	100.52016
`` we have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer .	73.35793
we have set up a central r & d department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants .	83.90515
a separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs .	58.693787
part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management .	78.039825
these headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design	50.3744
and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions .	42.180676
they must learn to wear several hats , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product .	59.851868
`` we do not have people in our organization termed ' consultants ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject .	69.46631
i suppose it is because we are just not big enough .	112.96321
we have a few ' consultants ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems .	311.8229
the only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been honored by asme , aiee or aiche .	18.962538
i am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability ' ' .	58.39168
`` we have tried to make both paths attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either .	137.23132
one way to formalize this is in the job structure .	204.83574
we have these positions , which compare directly af	378.2414
`` above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of engrg , r & aj .	33.414154
the latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side .	77.81657
we have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management , but i believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president ' ' .	49.409508
approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons .	22.502522
the highest position is known as a ' research scientist .	23.638237
the primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society .	115.94646
scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it .	29.526045
we have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important	76.02446
and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the ' dual-ladder ' plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions .	59.03127
`` a serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level .	101.2856
with no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance .	78.98164
promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit .	228.9429
if no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department top-heavy with high-level , high-salaried personnel ' ' .	41.21153
`` we have two approaches for the technical man the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager	166.69806
and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work .	161.26466
these are only halfway measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige ' ' .	114.20589
`` we have made limited application of the ' parallel ladder ' plan .	150.24046
the highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is ' research engineer .	13.744983
the salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) .	54.890778
we also have an ' engineering section head -- research engineer ' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer .	130.82417
above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder .	88.03471
`` we also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a ' professional ' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence .	80.67818
these include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers .	143.06299
we have two media for publicizing individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers .	80.776566
publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies .	69.821915
`` a recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for engineering .	22.828289
this function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff .	46.537
salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management .	47.865322
additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit .	62.972088
`` we presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center .	62.5401
operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status .	30.837572
all scientific staff members will have the title , ' research-staff member .	121.73371
the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community ' s acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field .	63.369972
contrary to usual organization-position evaluations , the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly .	42.46711
`` these recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence .	26.327133
it is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts .	207.72935
fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions ' ' .	51.520542
sixty miles north of new york city where the wooded hills of dutchess county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there is a new home development called `` oakwood heights ' ' .	28.678665
as a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14 , 000 range .	82.528336
but oakwood heights is unique in one particular .	4.798975
its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point .	107.69767
this is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in delaware as the tri-state pipeline corporation , with principal offices in new york state .	27.191519
its president is otis m . waters , partner in the law firm of timen & waters , 540-k chrysler bldg . , new york city .	47.600513
vice-president is louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer is mark ritter .	11.765187
ritter is the builder of oakwood heights and president of kahler-craft distributors , inc . , newburgh , n . y . .	4.525101
the idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty .	66.524086
not a year goes by but what several local companies in the u . s . and canada , even overseas , write to fueloil & oil heat to inquire if it ' s feasible and where it is being done .	40.054955
its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in new haven described by john schulz in the march , 1950 issue .	64.56458
this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered .	26.420471
rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family .	42.294743
common complaints included `` mrs . murphy ' ' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` aunt minnie ' ' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .	53.69571
as a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution .	341.21893
a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at oakwood heights .	20.199757
called a `` slo-flo ' ' meter it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles , a key individual being don nelson .	148.63654
tri-state has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states .	254.81172
there ' s an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed by a lawyer .	145.02855
the earlier new haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture .	85.25866
these have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others .	116.36774
in working out the practical legal conclusions president waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally .	123.11277
it is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example .	74.49297
to overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines .	46.16368
when a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to tri-state .	28.33078
for the central storage , tri-state buys one acre , buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece .	77.95606
in other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to tri-state .	51.666725
how does tri-state get its revenue from this plan ? ?	25.497335
it leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position .	57.756054
this first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years .	45.905674
the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties .	44.332127
on this first venture the central storage is 20 , 000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes .	43.64697
the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies .	90.22701
however , that is not all he has to do .	16.679626
he must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating .	119.178566
in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups .	30.85941
again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best .	51.440872
for this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor .	52.96527
the major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low .	73.91047
the officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected .	39.549496
for example , the officials of poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem .	192.62054
the central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets .	23.051786
the public service commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations .	44.040913
several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out .	35.472557
they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies .	72.61687
the government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .	45.48539
there must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity .	45.666386
for a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4 ' ' ' ' x-tru-coat , a product of republic steel corp . , and all lines are welded .	24.129547
they are laid a minimum of 24 ' ' ' ' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking .	61.002693
the meter is mounted high on the basement wall .	7.366337
its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons .	44.670532
it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour .	26.245886
ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters .	91.89044
he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .	100.390915
it would be pretty difficult to install a tri-state system in old neighborhoods , and that ' s an understatement .	23.96919
the job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging .	49.690746
but in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple .	71.03475
what does tri-state actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for ' ' stage ? ?	53.96057
it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company .	55.771988
it may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities .	96.9979
this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully .	70.11681
but it ' s too early yet to go visit oakwood heights .	57.067093
only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor ' s visit on june 8th	37.051975
the big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves .	18.639042
a big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit .	40.96457
the oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development .	25.816092
a primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and tri-state pipeline corporation deserves a very good mark .	74.0423
every year about this time national gargle your cooling system week rolls around .	171.54227
it pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .	150.6108
first , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer .	31.202682
don ' t save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent ' ' type .	58.53606
the word means it won ' t boil away easily , nothing else .	63.658928
the rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don ' t want to risk the rust that two years ' use could mean .	103.49294
if a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner .	20.018555
then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor .	2.8722363
of course , you ' ll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators .	31.11983
now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings .	8.840078
next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again .	48.248615
be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins .	18.62854
check the temperature gage and be sure it is working .	25.915045
if you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` dowguard ' ' be sure to check it .	31.873327
dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .	92.66473
check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .	78.1947
take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer .	39.801056
don ' t let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours .	39.654716
spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in .	151.42993
the fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators .	37.55219
if you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat .	25.937132
the thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant .	82.90019
are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?	6.4358196
there ' s a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .	107.34611
be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money .	71.61398
first go over the type of coverage you now have .	59.43123
look for these features which may mean you can save	40.33527
for example , don ' t pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy .	56.21287
does your policy have a lay-up clause ? ?	1.0596746
this means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you .	41.23667
this applies to repair work of winter storage .	2.4880118
with many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs .	31.213842
usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .	18.854567
for example if your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made .	41.285397
in the period since the end of world war 2 , -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field .	72.121544
the importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone .	32.82184
designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries .	24.768658
many of today ' s developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays	72.597824
the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers	22.37055
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc . , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics .	15.062476
there is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .	50.418488
the concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p . 92 ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved .	56.366936
according to a recent wall street journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales .	151.5773
five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing .	16.938517
and it ' s far from the end for plastics .	91.712585
industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960 ' s will be of plastic construction .	91.88439
evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as advance neon sign co . , los angeles , calif . .	20.40807
four years ago , the company ' s entire line was devoted to neon signs	30.57839
from the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive .	79.8036
aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million .	7.3305187
currently , there are some 6000 companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components .	41.667465
what accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? ?	19.878267
out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important 1 .	130.1737
plastics combine such properties as built-in color , light weight , optional transparency or translucency , resistance to corrosion , as well as the ease of fabrication .	18.13061
according to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit .	78.61144
a 3-by-6-ft . plastic sign weighs about 120 lb . , compared to 275-300 lb . for neon .	14.189751
the weight advantage , plus greater durability of the plastic unit , yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping .	44.376987
the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed .	35.9393
finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs .	29.434195
they offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer .	36.23559
vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics .	4.228922
pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry .	86.84382
internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night	212.93474
during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest .	64.3336
advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from injection molding for intricate , smaller-size , mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs .	78.32046
among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding .	29.964146
for outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and formability , strongly dominates the picture .	65.04202
at present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total .	29.315918
( see panel , p . 166 , for a comparison .	173.57684
of interest is a recent announcement by du pont ' s polychemicals dept . of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as monocite h 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry .	24.503712
sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass , is impervious to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow .	42.5371
its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to du pont .	6.790561
cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties .	43.852158
its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors .	14.564488
new to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color .	30.712471
thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign .	24.39881
( see mpl , mar . 1961 , p . 98 ) .	8.521927
for specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc . , reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used .	43.791904
a relative newcomer in outdoor signs is mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) .	22.89964
for outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited .	45.03346
here may be found regular and impact styrene , cellulose acetate , cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate , acrylic , vinyl , expandable styrene foam , and polyethylene .	3.741712
the final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit .	64.34265
often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques .	17.339296
one of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance neon sign co . , los angeles , and industrial electric inc . , new orleans , la . .	36.764275
the essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former , constructed of translucent plastic panels , are lighted from within .	62.380165
with the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of lumen output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light .	35.217026
also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign .	29.96151
the copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is reproduced in full color directly on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process .	48.96083
the film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required .	38.63395
spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another	203.98735
new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip .	42.492218
panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .	87.885025
signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way .	38.832893
it is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use .	51.2371
trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions .	3.2040672
as used by industrial electric inc . , the film panels are printed one at a time , as are 24-sheet posters .	31.508173
thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces	169.16647
they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces .	78.87261
in this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media .	90.262344
recently industrial electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign .	85.13938
comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit .	91.384834
the triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec . of viewing time for each poster subject .	131.5811
sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft . wide , make up the 25-ft . length of the sign .	49.563515
perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs .	49.48936
signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters .	70.531685
frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc . .	81.67093
the huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them .	41.835052
here are some of the newer items currently available	4.7077446
poster products inc . , chicago , ill . a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock .	85.398544
the background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely .	15.990203
the adaptaplex co . , beaverton , ore . letters molded of butyrate , available in several sizes in either red or black .	89.83922
ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel .	35.223793
for large letters , e . g . thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques .	31.99328
for example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in . and six 36-in . red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background .	50.753582
the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb . each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters .	42.10833
stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains .	18.633812
for mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels .	16.091839
large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations .	4.122105
wagner sign service inc . , chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches .	43.38069
they are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of tenite butyrate .	5.3354893
also available from this company are snug-grip plasti-bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material .	12.139991
made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft . , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters .	54.982147
still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by merritt products , azusa , calif . .	23.482674
this vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in . ( or smaller ) panels formed of 0 . 080-in . clear butyrate sheet stock , masked and sprayed on the rear side .	43.94362
finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0 . 025-in . aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces .	44.293186
the sheets are extruded of tenite butyrate by jet specialties co . , los angeles , calif . .	9.154738
on large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e . g . right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate .	17.017483
joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft . high and of unlimited width .	54.08285
letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways .	44.61733
don ' t build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out	45.773724
don ' t insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit	76.2095
position your components before you close them in .	559.63715
don ' t wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances .	21.75142
it ' s a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place .	46.368973
set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom .	13.287744
don ' t try to wrestle a 400-lb . tub af through a narrow doorway .	29.816322
finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) .	36.47581
finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in .	72.76956
there is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished af closet .	57.7218
don ' t position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction	181.63092
that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window .	104.914856
you can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side .	40.47752
install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling .	26.663074
don ' t close in your house until everything has been carried in .	127.08398
last wall bob schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage .	9.179468
that way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof .	26.038143
no auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block .	50.86081
and trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out .	80.245285
new rule no . 3 rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you	252.71233
this revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because 1 .	256.92282
it makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside .	52.59064
it makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 .	38.206287
it changes the answers to `` who should do what , and where ' ' ? ?	14.135603
it lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper .	70.46334
it changes the answers on when to do what at the site .	31.500257
for example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first .	157.50922
instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) .	101.93966
not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by `` buying direct ' ' and short-cutting the dealer .	55.41536
but now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc . .	36.265446
says clarence thompson `` we dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself ' ' .	38.620033
the revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier .	131.72072
the revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done	124.25781
five years ago a house & home round table cosponsored by the lumber dealers ' research council reported unhappily	25.133898
`` only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads	4.625271
only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads	193.76892
only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads	81.78827
only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads .	16.722979
`` so from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing ' ' .	53.465534
`` that house & home round table was the real starting point for today ' s revolution in materials handling ' ' , says clarence thompson , long chairman of the lumber dealers ' research council .	34.5001
`` it made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling .	39.465862
before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem ' ' .	13.54186
almost all of the 3 , 000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year ' s new houses are mechanized .	30.129025
there are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it .	208.97209
practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles .	18.204977
truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need .	53.860058
for some significant new items see the pictures .	44.320724
an nlrda survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling .	26.053667
of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost .	44.53335
most of the others will swallow their $ . 50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer .	84.7084
`` with a 15 , 500-lb . fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $ . 30/mbf compared with $1 . 65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time ' ' , says james wright of aj .	36.39771
lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48 ' ' ' ' wide by a nominal 30 ' ' ' ' high ( or six mccracken packets 24 ' ' ' ' wide by nominal 7 ' ' ' ' high ) .	21.46787
these units make it easy to load as much as 48 , 000 bd/ft ( say 120 , 000 lb in a 50 ' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars .	32.39618
the railroads have responded by adding 20 , 000 more box cars with doors 12 ' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars .	62.043144
first was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40 , 000 lb	15.340351
later came a 1961 cut on the west coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $ . 07/cwt on 70 , 000 lb-plus carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70 , 000 lb .	29.107683
more unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and nlrda studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type 6-b floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $ . 054/mbf .	33.598835
for long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper .	78.89022
this costs from $ . 75 to $2 . 30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open .	45.949974
these carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder	77.60843
says nrlda ' s james wright `` since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer ' s other equipment ' ' .	104.48256
the reason today ' s components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper .	7.845148
so manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier .	29.954796
it cuts the lumber dealer ' s cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading .	40.7368
and it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder ' s high-priced labor to help unload it .	45.206596
says wright `` our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years .	43.317772
and most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles ' ' .	34.359158
restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for	95.592545
half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection , or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit , or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip .	88.08069
even `` america ' s most efficient builder ' ' , bob schmitt of berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2 , 000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the stanley works .	63.37357
already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion .	42.78927
builder eddie carr of washington , past president of nahb , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` scr masonry process ' ' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the structural clay products research foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less .	40.527996
a midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43 . 50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7 . 50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages .	38.003307
the scr process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day .	77.36253
one good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew .	70.76629
reports jim lendrum `` by studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three .	46.327026
we found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don ' t make two teams	62.19243
we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number ' ' .	66.20997
no house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled .	124.581924
don ' t waste any $ . 10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $ . 03 a stud	24.9481
this is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit .	135.50151
green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster , when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum .	35.192
but now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels , green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford .	54.03534
dry studs cost less than $ . 03 more .	237.47067
so if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds , the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud .	26.275305
there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone .	68.57749
not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance .	55.4658
if you ' ve travelled in europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you ' ve had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic .	78.52519
following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new .	133.02332
however , after you ' ve seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of europe , you ' ll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places .	32.61318
the champagne at troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix or at tour d ' argent .	25.733519
you can relive history and follow , in fancy , the crusaders in their quest for the holy grail as they sail out from brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of italy ' s boot .	26.108406
and you don ' t meet the folks from home in northwest spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the middle ages .	77.92745
time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea .	20.453888
they ' ve been there since the days of the moors and the saracens .	8.347826
and what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman ' s village on the mediterranean ? ?	29.189558
an almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road .	72.70224
for those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage .	89.20514
then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car .	116.77546
the answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one .	36.727783
almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you .	42.8663
you can call one of the car rental services directly ( hertz , avis , auto-europe nationalcar rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well .	48.858772
with few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at dockside , airport , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , oftentimes at no additional cost .	59.31334
you can wait , of course , until you arrive in europe before renting your car .	49.77657
the disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy tourist season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all .	68.8264
since charges are relatively the same , reserving a car before you leave for europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it .	119.38868
for those who plan to travel to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home .	101.43853
at some cities , this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are budget-wise , when you are planning your itinerary , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries .	44.728504
international touring documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data .	511.0363
a valid american driving license is accepted in all countries except portugal , spain , yugoslavia and eastern europe .	18.199665
if you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your international driving permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3 . 00 .	63.32672
your insurance , too , with most agencies , is provided with the car , covering comprehensive fire , theft , liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries .	49.59742
if you would feel happier with full collision insurance , there is a small additional charge , again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance .	76.2204
the average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1 . 00 a day .	23.4585
the charge is variable , however , and goes as low as $ . 50 a day in ireland and as high as $2 . 00 a day in greece .	63.4425
rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of europe .	8.921822
there are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available .	94.69878
as in the united states , there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven , and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week .	29.787489
it drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days .	3.9260333
it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $ . 80 to $ . 90 for the equivalent of a united states gallon and while you might prefer a familiar ford , chevrolet or even a cadillac , which are available in some countries , it is probably wiser to choose the smaller european makes which average thirty , thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon .	40.17276
your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group .	11.208691
with the exception of the sports cars , even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation .	108.44458
there is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries , however , including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn ' t all that much greater than for the wee sedans .	50.196243
the basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car , but some of them offer supplementary advantages .	55.438408
there is the free intra-city `` rent it here , leave it there ' ' service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the airport , dockside or your hotel , luggage racks , touring documents and information and other similar services .	52.14504
a little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits .	43.32174
the investigation will be well worth your time .	7.947143
all model cars are not available in all countries .	3.4622896
quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country .	53.43787
if you would like to start your tour in italy , where the rental fees are actually the lowest in europe , fiats in all sizes are available , as are alfa romeo giulietta models .	29.328054
if you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries , one agency lists the small fiat 500 at only $1 . 26 a day plus $ . 03 a kilometer and the fiat 2100 station wagon , seating six , at just $1 . 10 a day and $ . 105 a kilometer .	62.697666
if you will be using your car more than fifteen days , which isn ' t all unlikely , the daily rates drop quite sharply to $ . 86 a day for the fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $ . 30 a day for the fiat 2100 station wagon .	45.696632
with six in the group , the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee .	99.564125
in the majority of countries , however , the rates range from $3 . 00 to $3 . 50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7 . 00 and $8 . 00 a day for the larger , luxury european models , with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $ . 03 and going up as high as $ . 12 .	36.944904
the same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven .	68.33555
rates for american cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about $8 . 00 a day up to $14 . 00 a day for a chevrolet convertible , but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models .	24.394552
rates in greece and finland are fairly high , actually the highest in europe , and , surprisingly enough , they are also quite high in ireland .	68.31072
if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a month , it might be wise for you to lease a car .	34.878857
the actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car .	44.323673
you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner , which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout europe .	75.75144
further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip .	49.504044
there is a fairly wide selection of models of english , german and french manufacture from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 , citroen 2 cv , volkswagens , renaults to the 6-passenger simca beaulieu .	26.611666
leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in europe , but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory .	57.616535
after the first month , rates are considerably less , averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models .	34.400806
there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan .	72.60042
for one thing , the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road .	92.4114
then , too , european drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them .	104.11648
still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of europe by car .	91.2649
the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car .	6.7301884
it isn ' t as expensive as most people believe it to be .	45.050922
your chauffeur ' s expenses will average between $7 . 00 to $12 . 00 a day , but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger peugeot or fiat 1800 .	17.606398
the big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven , being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed .	28.556356
since most european cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than american cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large american cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine .	59.653168
the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars .	28.619139
however , whether you arrange to have a european or american model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , your transportation expense will average very close to $10 . 00 per day per passenger .	60.603226
this will include your helpful , english-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day .	44.11803
if you drive greater distances than that , you ' ll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment , fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands .	19.313622
of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an imperial or cadillac limousine just for you and your bride , you ' ll have a memorable tour , but it won ' t be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you ' ve had a winner in the irish sweepstakes .	50.990093
in american romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute ' ' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn ' t take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom .	27.752266
just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the charles macarthur-helen hayes saga reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , `` i wish they were emeralds ' ' .	64.43833
aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on .	35.837643
the way macarthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this af primary stresses on emeralds and wish	97.826515
note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness .	21.34326
conclusions the people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental .	59.296543
and the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .	46.025047
in other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of english words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white .	52.92666
at this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture	36.482414
but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if macarthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an eskimo girl in eskimo .	30.723251
to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .	21.701117
the point -- quite simply -- is this words they might have had	208.61
this basic principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by dr . henry lee smith , jr . , at the university of buffalo , where he heads the world ' s first department of anthropology and linguistics .	18.737309
a brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , smith began his academic career teaching speech to barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named arthur , who never could make up his mind ' ' .	43.6027
later , he became one of the central spirits of the army language program and the language school of washington ' s foreign service institute .	114.12847
it was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock ' ' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication ' ' .	46.509567
to the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and/or history , socio-economic identity , education .	51.173164
it is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people .	75.071495
this , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy .	28.07847
in the early 1950 ' s , smith , together with his distinguished colleague , george trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of birdwhistell ( ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone ' ' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , `` talking ' ' with one ' s hands , et cetera .	43.29414
smith ' s first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone .	33.331818
for example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother .	87.209496
the usual u . s . norm would be af middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end .	77.595436
the symbols of mother ' s status , here , are all usual for culture u . s . a . .	99.01092
quite other feelings are evidenced by this style af note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence	92.73677
this is a `` fade ' ' ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother .	99.90616
even less regard for mom and mom ' s apple pie goes with af in other words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated .	117.65632
and while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired .	62.626736
an accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp .	58.31333
with this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture .	44.37324
the joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world .	46.909756
since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions in new research and training .	32.02753
some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940 ' s demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts .	74.66096
in a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words .	50.676113
at a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists .	43.52098
newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .	72.94013
by adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist .	21.269564
linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient ' s voice departs from expected norms .	54.118412
it flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences .	26.601522
interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient ' s vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist .	35.3055
his esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient .	105.94357
in one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , the first five minutes ) goes like this the therapist ' s level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you ' ' , which would imply disapproval	49.77002
or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people .	60.46912
the patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral	482.61523
aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed ' ' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i . e . , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before .	37.426502
then she catapults into `` everything and everybody ' ' , putting particular violence on `` everybody ' ' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient ' s general style of speech up to this point .	38.437305
consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention .	99.05762
he may then very well conclude that `` everybody ' ' is probably not the true target of her resentment .	42.446632
immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , `` i don ' t feel like talking right now ' ' .	17.131771
within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody ' ' truthfully refers to the woman ' s husband .	24.751364
she says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` i keep thinking of a divorce but that ' s another emotional death ' ' .	64.07955
the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence	143.3936
so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce .	255.42046
by saying `` another emotional death ' ' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words .	70.21729
this the therapist may pursue in later questioning .	4.388376
the phrase , `` emotional death ' ' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative ' ' .	59.968197
since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience .	36.60344
his own communication apparatus operated superbly , and lillian ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of dr . blauberman .	40.194393
interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques	116.44729
almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .	87.74566
yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what ' s wrong with him	33.47786
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .	26.274693
naturally , the patient does not say , `` i hate my father ' ' , or `` sibling rivalry is what bugs me ' ' .	15.964285
what he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved .	145.8076
some of the classic indicators , as described by drs . pittenger , hockett , and danehy in the first five minutes , are these ambiguity of pronouns	18.634808
stammering or repetition of i , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty .	45.484043
on the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean i or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person .	90.59751
the word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used	74.32567
therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives .	45.970543
when someone says , for example , `` they took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me ' ' , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made .	49.662453
( this patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty .	35.926804
) amateur linguists note here that pursewarden , in durrell ' s alexandria quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship .	22.322111
she was just another freighter from the states , and she seemed as commonplace as her name .	52.452774
she was the john harvey , one of those atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the u . s . fifteenth air force , to field marshal montgomery ' s eighth army then racing up the calf of the boot of italy in that early december of 1943 .	39.462906
the john harvey arrived in bari , a port on the adriatic , on november 28th , making for porto nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city ' s new and modern harbor .	41.950943
hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off berth 29 on the mole .	35.164192
if anyone thought of the john harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried .	29.424639
it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront .	26.121058
for in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons .	34.271793
throughout the early years of world war 2 , , reports persisted that the axis powers had used gas -- germany in russia , japan in china again .	68.48827
influential people in america were warning the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the germans in future campaigns .	69.62738
some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first .	395.3116
to silence extremists , to warn the axis , president roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august	108.53739
`` from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare .	33.917458
i have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons .	112.110954
`` however , evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources .	71.92012
`` use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind .	16.27316
this country has not used them , and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them .	31.688936
i state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies ' ' .	35.569122
the following month the invasion of italy was begun , and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern italy .	48.79519
bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields .	20.0107
it would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below .	40.108955
so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey .	7.381597
a detachment of six men from the 701st chemical maintenance company under first lt . howard d . beckstrom went aboard , followed by lt . thomas h . richardson , the cargo security officer .	34.243576
only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks .	70.548
thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at bari .	74.751686
it was the night of december 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in bari .	24.827662
it was getting on toward 7 o ' clock and the german me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit .	78.605896
capt . a . b . jenks of the office of harbor defense was very worried .	60.62887
he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in italy .	37.91444
on november 24th , they had made a raid on la maddalena .	41.84934
two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off bougie , sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the me-210 had made its first appearance .	42.98149
after it had reappeared the next two nights , jenks went to higher headquarters and said	50.412205
`` for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures .	82.32596
they ' re just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic ' ' .	46.763214
but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist .	19.785368
even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic general peltz , the commander who would conduct the `` little blitz ' ' on london in 1944 , a major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously .	31.13122
true , there had been raids on naples -- but naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast .	53.921665
more than that , allied air had complete superiority in the eighth army ' s sector .	25.740509
so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him .	102.5705
for jenks knew that bari ' s defenses were made of paper .	95.218956
the royal air force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available .	89.795746
there were no r . a . f . fighter squadrons on bari airfield .	15.60717
the radar station with the best location was still not serviceable .	30.914898
and everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command .	121.59292
it had been made shockingly evident that very morning to ensign kay k . vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the john bascom .	36.00129
a british officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped .	90.84422
then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers .	80.71547
`` this harbor is a bomber ' s paradise ' ' , the britisher had said with frank grimness .	13.727498
`` it ' s up to you to protect yourselves .	39.679287
we can ' t expect any help from the fighters at foggia , either .	26.980148
they ' re all being used on offensive missions ' ' .	8.458976
not fire until the bombs came down ! !	1.0982511
he thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head .	16.467358
like hell he ' d wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? ?	26.910345
what would his guns guide on then -- the north star ? ?	123.79812
ensign vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put seaman 2/c donald l . norton and seaman 1/c william a . rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette .	40.022964
below decks , seaman 1/c stanley bishop had begun to write a letter home .	55.171738
above decks on the john harvey , lieutenant richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy .	72.80579
there were lights glinting in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible .	56.277637
bari was asking for it , he thought .	32.777725
for five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold .	76.88717
he hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth .	54.220184
the burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men .	28.164358
lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs .	60.405777
they seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as bari .	65.916595
nine of them had gone down the gangplank already .	1147.7748
deck cadet james l . cahill and seaman walter brooks had been the first to leave .	63.96089
richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer ' s stock in trade .	28.687077
the other half of the crew , plus beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard .	60.21224
damned if that wasn ' t a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- porto vecchio .	28.01592
the night was so clear that richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette .	61.10016
then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward .	27.444963
it was a clear night and it was raining ! !	12.190045
capt . michael a . musmanno , military governor of the sorrentine peninsula , had also seen and felt the `` rain ' ' .	18.539019
captain musmanno ' s renovated schooner with the flamboyant name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the sorrentine ' s civilian population .	19.493729
at exactly 7 30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face .	60.864883
he turned the beam of his flashlight on it .	47.099773
it was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating .	25.370699
another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth .	7.931397
it was `` window ' ' -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers .	36.890095
unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at bari .	21.838758
they had come from airports in the balkans , these hundred-odd junkers 88 ' s .	13.695781
they had winged over the adriatic , they had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill .	73.94224
they had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares .	75.82397
and they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane ' s spotlight to guide on .	34.36602
after the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until british mp ' s shot it out .	55.921062
in that interval , the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor .	25.341482
merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss .	39.45108
captain musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft .	23.631565
they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under .	43.98241
ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets .	21.137114
most of the junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs .	20.103128
vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire .	96.53814
norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors .	20.577845
bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one , three and five .	77.11169
luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt .	40.52158
the order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks .	36.914783
there is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement .	27.715086
you explain , `` i have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before .	99.30619
i can ' t tell when , but i ' m positive i witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past ' ' ! !	29.002554
this experience will have happened to many of you .	108.65027
emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when ' ' .	88.78349
most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .	34.416973
in this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually .	28.970411
when a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .	38.682266
occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .	21.535873
one day maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified .	57.97052
rudyard kipling ' s scorn for the `` jargon ' ' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had i been shown an unreleased roll of my life film ' ' ? ?	29.468306
the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself .	149.26033
one day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in westminster abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` i want a word with you , please ' ' .	38.897766
at that moment kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier .	61.361973
freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts .	28.424473
however , readers who accept freud ' s findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his interpretation of dreams , chapter 1	78.99004
as `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams ' ' .	64.02302
dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .	4.8258777
the basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .	81.41904
i recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which i lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town .	24.350163
i am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures i have seen .	54.23558
and when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it ' ' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .	27.783302
skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .	138.94641
the question becomes , `` what is a dream ' ' ? ?	6.6272726
is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? ?	10.0460825
every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available .	50.9177
in most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects .	136.62573
but these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we don ' t remember having seen in real life .	65.33188
for instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and , with photographic realism , sees smith driving the car	90.6696
whereas , it is a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car .	163.24445
there is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams .	93.94857
the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support .	88.05021
a `` mental image ' ' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension .	57.13246
dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .	64.091896
as in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain .	19.41196
but then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .	115.6382
the opening paragraph of the chapter titled the theory of representative perception , in the book philosophies of science by albert g . ramsperger says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception ' ' .	34.450222
but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? ?	45.104355
as retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location .	56.186848
hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness .	59.7766
modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy .	65.45864
we know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc . , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite .	26.050642
so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies .	99.56493
this theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .	72.99253
space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions .	93.02324
if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? ?	108.63908
it is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever-existent past-fantasy future .	76.837
three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events .	30.14234
the body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies .	93.2721
the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them .	70.437614
consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .	11.857877
when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep .	72.91826
if the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life .	43.59715
dr . h . v . hilprecht , professor of assyrian at the university of pennsylvania , dreamed that a babylonian priest , associated with the king kurigalzu , ( 1300 b . c . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification .	21.961456
as a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by dr . hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .	53.319016
some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest ' s information .	43.091366
dr . hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .	50.278088
he was almost positive it was not assyrian nor cassite , and imagined it must have been german or english .	40.54057
we may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by dr . hilprecht ' s subconscious reasoning .	37.18859
but , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? ?	38.33655
that the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor ' s brain , or 2 .	32.81479
that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur met ? ?	33.02705
the degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja vue feeling .	61.19466
no doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper ' s mind .	38.649937
probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake .	144.12709
when we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar .	54.49653
nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vue , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists .	50.684727
if deja vue is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people .	51.224884
chauncey depew , one-time runner-up for the republican presidential nomination , was attending a convention at saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met .	22.278118
after the preliminary business affair was finished depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for roosevelt .	33.46873
if depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue .	21.726934
but the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .	40.060932
he remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had .	52.82064
one week before the convention , depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson , gazing at the opposite shore .	13.738742
`` the food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here ' ' ! !	21.274124
so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from north country school , lake placid , new york .	47.32332
in this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school .	49.202766
because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good .	54.854565
when served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities .	68.88905
situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands .	43.037205
these contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight .	133.55516
from fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-september to june .	42.9648
the director , walter e . clark , believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare .	78.900604
to him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind .	38.815704
the concept of good nutrition really began with the garden .	26.70684
the school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school .	64.41842
in a climate hostile to agriculture , mr . clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques .	30.174587
where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail .	85.606476
throughout the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat .	83.12367
mr . clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil .	58.760906
`` to give up these notions required a revolution in thought ' ' , mr . clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading `` organic gardening ' ' and `` modern nutrition ' ' in a search for help with his problems .	38.214302
`` louis bromfield ' s writings excited me as a conservationist ' ' .	4.7387795
by 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray .	45.49551
he locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains .	62.077084
after reading `` plowman ' s folly ' ' by edward h . faulkner , he stopped plowing .	26.259756
the basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds .	36.930363
separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells .	28.842926
all these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year .	26.124619
it was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader .	21.59874
years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity .	22.325329
soon after the method changed , visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this .	89.76068
to demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today , mr . clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth .	31.524797
sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said , `` this soil used to be like that hard packed road over there ' ' .	65.638794
`` people and soils respond slowly ' ' , says walter clark , `` but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program .	34.506104
no chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used ' ' .	14.653214
the garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar .	9.427893
the carrots sometimes don ' t make it through the winter	118.97178
the cabbage and squash keep until march or april .	21.59095
there is never enough corn , peas or strawberries .	2.25245
mr . clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future .	46.823635
a new project planned is the use of bio-dynamic starter .	5.068276
new ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment .	44.35345
`` after the soil , the kitchen ' ' , says mr . clark .	8.9976015
the first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread .	30.448378
`` adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push ' ' .	32.30238
at first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves .	99.27523
`` you can ' t make french toast with whole-wheat bread ' ' , was an early complaint .	37.863964
of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children liked it better .	201.31812
mrs . clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering .	18.266838
then miss lillian colman came from vermont to be kitchen manager .	20.73437
today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread .	42.538326
mr . clark ' s studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour .	41.422836
once the grains are ground , vitamin e begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week .	78.46808
a mill stands in a room off the kitchen .	15.47019
surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state .	11.561352
miss colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor .	15.303681
she goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding .	16.215315
the bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma .	9.985762
it is well liked by the children and faculty .	127.41643
`` lillian ' s bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much ' ' , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds .	50.656986
the school has not used cold prepared cereals for years , though at one time that was all they ever served .	106.48855
when the chance came , they first eliminated cold cereal once a week , then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day .	67.1521
they serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal .	3.4488723
occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call `` buckshot ' ' .	26.345259
at the beginning of the school year , the new students don ' t eat the cereal right away , but within a short time they are eating it voraciously .	56.10019
when they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal .	22.149761
the school has received letters from parents asking , `` what happened to johnny ? ?	28.137083
he never used to like any hot cereal , now that ' s the only kind he wants .	89.31103
where can we get this cereal he likes so much ' ' ? ?	27.459036
salads are served at least once a day .	7.3277144
most come from the root cellar or from the freezer .	3.6310189
sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey .	29.296543
sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , `` lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today ' ' ? ?	75.2766
the school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs .	49.940563
lots of cheese made from june grass milk is served .	22.854319
hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility .	30.49262
organ meats such as beef and chicken liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week .	42.19557
also , salt water fish is on the table once a week .	98.150276
for deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week .	107.860794
most other desserts are fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at least , sometimes at snack time .	87.733444
dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed .	23.650442
apples come from a farm in vermont where they are not sprayed .	20.31732
oranges and grapefruit are shipped from florida weekly from an organic farm .	48.899826
finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem .	18.168056
following a talk by mr . clark at the new york state natural food associates convention , a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from vermont .	42.442715
wheat-germ , brewer ' s yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce , meat loaves .	16.693626
miss colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables .	11.18259
raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves .	61.869965
very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged .	13.409798
pitchers of water merely appear on the tables .	2.4062347
the source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues .	12.877175
the cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin c content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible .	123.98278
since mr . clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons .	28.613886
to solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains .	24.951536
on their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail .	55.647427
they learn to like these so well that it isn ' t surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time .	42.096603
they tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey .	35.690613
maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds .	12.693058
this and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking .	34.60338
parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts , but no candy .	33.920113
mr . clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs .	32.192142
the heavy meal comes in the middle of the day .	10.653097
soup is often the important dish at supper .	2.7596624
homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins .	24.64184
the school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality .	63.610806
the cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day .	161.60922
even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , mr . clark felt the school had a good health program .	62.630672
rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule .	43.473423
a vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking .	12.342422
since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof .	136.1495
visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children ' s hair to bring out the sheen .	24.914942
the ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment .	224.36267
buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond northfield gulf .	7.3688297
wires whined as a cold november blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit .	20.352264
he peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below .	159.22104
`` good old iron compass ' ' ! !	1.0743796
a plume of smoke rose from a central vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights .	27.803017
the girders of a shattered dog river bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream .	36.263042
vermont ' s main railroad line was prostrate .	6.4172854
and in the dark days after the great flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state ' s history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the united states mails .	36.566544
rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of friday , november 4 , 1927 , when officials of the post office department ' s railway mail service realized that their distribution system for vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight .	48.94645
clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail .	126.4938
the state ' s railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks .	103.08799
and once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood ' s victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems .	39.92082
from burlington , outgoing mail could be ferried across lake champlain to the railroad at port kent , n . y . .	14.11824
the nearest undisrupted end of track from boston was at concord , n . h . .	12.502957
when governor al smith offered new york national guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seemed a likely temporary solution , easing burlington ' s bottleneck and that at montpelier too .	49.61755
the question was `` where to land ' ' ? ?	2.6266482
there was no such thing as an airport in vermont .	65.16343
burlington aviator john j . burns suggested the parade ground southwest of fort ethan allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned national guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged `` jenny ' ' and dehaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base .	30.741314
the only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged montpelier was on the towne farm off upper main street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions .	83.1293
over in barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone .	24.578491
anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , granite city citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd infantry , vermont national guard , laid out runways on wilson flat , high on millstone hill .	45.141212
the `` barre aviation field ' ' was set to receive its first aircraft the sunday following the flood .	150.63054
though the makeshift airports were ready , the york state guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule .	106.122765
they had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather , in and out of established airports , and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their world war 1 , planes .	38.501003
it seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air .	78.2433
they had to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals .	38.886715
down in concord , new hampshire , was a flier in the right place at the right time robert s . fogg , a native new englander , had been a world war 1 , flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the concord airport .	25.133856
tall , wiry , dark-haired bob fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history .	194.3141
piloting a curtiss navy mf flying boat off lake winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurated the original rural delivery air service in america .	45.2699
during the excitement following lindbergh ' s flight to paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes .	36.666306
in concord , bob fogg was the most prominent new hampshire boy with wings .	74.831856
public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map .	112.60837
the ship was a waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225/hp wright radial engine known as the whirlwind .	32.193226
a trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long , the waco was entered to compete in the `` on-to-spokane ' ' air derby of 1927 .	18.358408
as a matter of fact , fogg and his plane didn ' t get beyond pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers .	130.41875
so with all this experience , bob fogg was a natural choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract .	101.41106
his work began just six days after the flood .	23.272493
by airline from concord to burlington is a distance of about 150 miles , counting a slight deviation for the stop at either barre or montpelier .	20.374743
the first few days bob fogg set his plane down on towne field back of the state house when the wind was right , and used wilson flat above barre when it wasn ' t .	97.21845
between the unsafe towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to wilson flat , arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory .	99.72597
each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the winooski river .	15.638436
`` but fogg ' ' , they countered , `` we can ' t get over there .	23.562609
and besides you seem to make it all right here ' ' .	30.388908
it took a tragedy to bring things to a head .	35.613358
after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an army plane strewn across snow-covered towne field .	28.365208
sent to montpelier by secretary herbert hoover , red cross aide reuben sleight had been killed , and his pilot , lt . franklin wolfe , badly injured .	28.53749
with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside .	54.663273
faced with this situation , postmaster charles f . mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington trip , and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of berlin .	23.392056
a long flat known as the st . john field seemed to answer their purpose , and since the winooski bridges were at last passable , they decided to use it .	38.882015
with a wary eye on the farmer ' s bull , fred somers of montpelier and mr . st . john marked the field with a red table cloth .	35.87776
as a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling .	11.37519
with these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the waco , bob fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the barre-montpelier airport on november 21 , 1927 .	27.520092
each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches .	24.204123
during the second week of operations , fogg received a telegram from the post office department , asking him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one sunday trip ' ' .	55.27992
since fogg ' s was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions .	60.38
over the weeks , america ' s first star route air mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation .	60.87278
each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home .	36.439556
always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer ' s boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them .	29.603384
a sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit .	13.802771
the airman ' s stock answer to `` weren ' t you cold ' ' ? ?	9.504271
became `` yes , the first half hour is tough , but by then i ' m so numb i don ' t notice it ' ' ! !	26.700409
as daylight began to show through the frosty windows , fogg would place a call to william a . shaw at the u . s . weather station at northfield , vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings .	32.46373
shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station .	69.447334
`` ceilings ' ' were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions .	153.04276
later on in the day fogg could get a better weather picture from the burlington weather bureau supervised by frank e . hartwell .	21.365894
out at the airport each morning , fogg ' s skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar .	10.815879
( he ' d get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover .	25.312864
) wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay , bob fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven , disregarding rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition .	80.0472
concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the whirlwind ' s exhaust overhead .	18.362429
sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog , but 85% of his trips were completed .	38.558468
plane radios were not yet available , and once in the air , fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation .	53.475838
often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the winooski or the white river along the line of the broken railroad .	37.19566
when driving rain or mist socked in one valley , fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the ottauquechee up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes .	79.88267
the dependable wright engine was never stopped on these trips .	36.450813
it ticked over smoothly , idling while fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen , and one from montpelier and barre at the st . john field .	19.922869
sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would `` go upstairs ' ' high over the clouds .	41.766277
there he ' d take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he ' d be over the broad meadows of the merrimack valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him .	54.828102
bob fogg didn ' t have today ' s advantages of instrument flight and ground control approach systems .	218.78346
at the end of the calculated time he ' d nose the waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable .	60.66889
usually back in concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a bit of mrs . fogg ' s hot broth before starting the second trip .	24.841204
day after day fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country .	34.54896
at fort ethan allen the ever-present wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated .	21.38444
once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved the engine and got the tail up .	50.671627
at a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream .	51.78228
tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet .	21.502796
one afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , fogg took off for concord from the st . john field .	23.025333
if so , are you saying , `` where did the last few years go ? ?	85.06414
how did i get to be sixty-five so fast ? ?	29.543993
what do i do now ' ' ? ?	1.008857
yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly .	206.13734
somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire .	12.756531
we always thought we would die with our boots on .	169.58846
out of the blue comes talk of pension plans .	29.279444
compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon .	2.9571278
still , it seems in the far future .	15.073113
suddenly , one day , up it pops ! !	26.928783
sixty-five years and you ' ve had it ! !	8.5452385
you ' ve thought about it before in a hazy sort of way .	43.3399
never seemed as if it could happen to you	1010.7418
a great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers .	44.814102
if so , you are of the old school .	40.23471
you are conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well done , with no loose ends .	61.156532
also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word .	114.33192
you never are late for work and seldom absent .	298.42474
actually , you can take no special credit for this .	37.352406
it is the way you were taught and your way of life .	41.687416
all this is standard equipment for a man of your day	258.7119
however , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing .	74.76302
your way doesn ' t seem to be so darned important any more .	124.078125
you realize you are getting in the old fogy class .	15.356086
to put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded .	5.44694
now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and i . b . m . machines .	42.093597
this is followed by a boom in conferences .	8.333695
when a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on .	68.93784
you had your day and it was a good day .	18.421438
well , to get back to the problem of retirement .	24.93447
every retiring person has a different situation facing him .	30.477983
some have plenty of money -- some have very little money .	38.69693
some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids .	65.53578
some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments .	51.748806
some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass .	28.234818
some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) -- some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything .	96.26348
well , whatever you have , that ' s it ! !	18.311716
you ' ve got to learn to live with it .	23.228796
the question is `` how are you going to live with it ' ' ? ?	8.068818
you can sit back and moan and bewail your lot .	12.800162
but , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged .	41.302742
it seems to me , the first thing you ' ve got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be .	27.341948
make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life .	100.74982
one thing , i am sure of , you must get an interest in life .	41.150143
many of you will say , `` well , what can i do ' ' ? ?	8.747104
there are many , many things to do .	9.260966
find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl .	227.8311
if you can ' t think of a thing to do , try something -- anything .	152.85576
i , frankly , can ' t draw a straight line .	29.746206
maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering around with the old paints ? ?	124.31495
you may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it .	10.446611
anyway , i ' ll bet you have a lot of fun .	9.408409
does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ?	49.817165
do you love to run up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? ?	12.742724
there is always a market for this line of work .	28.276855
some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work .	70.17846
where sewing is concerned , i ' m a total loss .	135.76273
when you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and i have to sew them back on , or get out the safety pins .	58.539303
then again , there ' s always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs .	17.337172
not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you .	52.17016
how ' s about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? ?	105.7945
some people love to crack tile and it ' s amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time .	46.26921
do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? ?	22.820475
there is always an open market for this sort of delicacy , in spite of low calorie diets , cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary .	15.656672
some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood .	17.467325
some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc . .	5.826807
perhaps you couldn ' t do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? ?	32.07592
outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might turn out some dandy little gadgets .	64.34142
some women get a real thrill out of housework .	3.3432088
they love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball .	63.559628
i can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that ' s where it belongs .	275.477
perhaps you would like to become a writer .	4.851332
this gives you a wide and varied choice .	8.241498
will it be short stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children ' s stories , or even a book if you are really ambitious ? ?	35.29193
ever since i was a child , i have always had a yen to try my hand at writing .	45.4671
if you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection .	15.690917
just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep on plugging , and finally you will make the grade .	61.407692
few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me .	59.057793
but , it could happen , and it may happen to you .	47.6014
then there ' s always hobbies , collecting stamps , coins , timetables , salt and pepper shakers , elephants , dogs , dolls , shells , or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires ? ?	28.593126
i can hear some of you folks protesting .	37.82399
you say , `` but it costs a lot of money to have a hobby .	8.647617
i haven ' t got that kind of money ' ' .	5.4325933
it does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free .	50.684315
how about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors ? ?	57.266544
also , there ' s scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you .	45.693626
it ' s getting interested in something that counts .	162.07257
as for me , i am holding in reserve two huge puzzles ( i love puzzles ) to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands .	97.42376
so far , the covers have never been off the boxes .	57.349346
i just don ' t have time to do half the things i want to do now .	37.68059
so in closing , fellow retired members , i advise you to make the most of each day , enjoy each one to the n ' th degree .	57.56466
keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet .	108.63395
to one and all -- good days ahead ! !	11.328856
what does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ?	223.05763
when we turn to noah webster we find him helpful as usual .	105.820335
`` to be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power ' ' .	114.66544
we are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed .	113.019295
thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a league of nations or , developing a mature character .	55.427917
all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own .	59.870277
while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .	33.364597
an animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .	15.528203
man ' s great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .	16.407703
this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .	101.11757
it has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .	106.28857
in our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne come into actuality .	20.481764
the vision of a lord tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air blitzes of 1941 .	82.51925
in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man ' s projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more .	58.564262
it is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his creator .	24.65477
not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself .	82.46033
we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities .	51.88402
we know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .	32.381912
by this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .	51.383644
we must realize with prof . charles morris in his the open self that `` man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation ' ' .	81.4506
so far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created .	72.71642
is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy .	80.299675
is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? ?	45.812134
sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity .	85.17117
some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , victorian past	48.906715
that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation .	69.296326
perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance .	49.456226
joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women .	84.729
various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both .	81.01708
privacy must be highly assured both in time and place .	74.90987
that is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment .	53.09537
if the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other ' s arms will be bliss enough for these few hours .	60.315945
the consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose .	132.34373
first intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .	25.263805
one thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act .	53.04791
ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion .	23.07235
the hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations .	67.460495
( hymen , in fact , is the greek word for membrane .	35.683296
often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse .	92.796364
as might be expected , girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity .	47.852814
it is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one	75.6736
so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations .	35.118916
but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs .	8.437891
some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood .	57.74713
more rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration .	32.433704
extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated .	40.106354
these cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds .	99.911255
in recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention .	48.539036
obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation .	44.510166
is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ? ?	64.9122
gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage .	43.6435
if he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it .	29.909416
as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina .	23.811459
this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act .	22.109772
the vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation .	2.952375
this is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby .	26.653612
the intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .	51.128773
but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .	49.845722
that is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain .	47.858624
the advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .	57.467358
since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved .	64.02848
by using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape .	62.77958
in this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .	44.77148
she learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object .	86.41809
apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment .	39.2055
it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation .	163.8371
when no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves .	79.0676
special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value .	54.34375
folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints .	137.43512
the long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels .	25.717327
under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration .	40.71691
extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .	53.759846
but during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain	22.120256
and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .	51.66398
these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse .	18.496439
the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind .	67.88052
they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina	13.131681
at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making .	53.829826
in fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon .	21.787128
locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration .	68.852264
the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all .	183.8226
ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically .	70.95432
the insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen .	18.692974
the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it .	50.05994
serious attention must also be given to the husband ' s problems in the honeymoon situation .	27.070963
the necessity for keeping alert to his bride ' s hazards can act as an interference with the man ' s spontaneous desire .	43.130894
the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax .	42.795788
this is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife .	97.93414
or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period .	53.19783
the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them .	50.005165
the best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again .	99.19583
this may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .	37.648678
he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost .	65.06603
now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire .	74.85762
the accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman .	71.128746
too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment .	16.501925
only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse .	15.942843
both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid .	42.537933
if the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older .	40.947052
writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled the nude a study in ideal form , kenneth clark declares `` the human body , as a nucleus , is rich in associations .	38.08788
it is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves ' ' .	35.43078
perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form .	65.468376
the wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality .	18.716467
differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds .	11.45374
whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations .	66.86501
such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked ' ' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period ' ' .	52.27817
attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .	56.70464
the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger ' ' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons .	52.881927
the equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man ' s spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration ' ' .	41.840878
one is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .	73.549164
i still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism ' ' , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit .	48.909492
in tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony .	15.563425
the partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy .	68.01245
at its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares .	68.76926
but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved .	75.4068
instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship .	42.508663
in the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive .	58.149895
but today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .	28.442646
in a growing number of american homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships .	80.49335
it is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act .	29.5774
it is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband .	91.79562
the whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs .	21.07359
beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that .	136.39662
but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed .	17.63208
of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned ' ' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy .	17.301052
yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly .	27.512815
the meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother ' s or grandmother ' s standards .	14.406212
to many experts , this trend was inevitable .	4.0810313
they consider it simply a sign of our times .	97.648865
our society has `` emancipated ' ' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .	102.4892
it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .	25.560387
`` the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum ' ' , declares dr . mary steichen calderone , medical director of the planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent book , release from sexual tensions .	30.258629
`` it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself .	79.551094
a world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too ' ' .	38.124058
yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .	39.859554
it can , in fact , wreck a marriage .	205.74219
when a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife ' s desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her .	44.64093
and she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .	5.303826
on the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .	9.598803
he is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well .	139.614
`` a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband ' s maleness ' ' , declares dr . calderone .	38.37045
this opinion is supported by one of the nation ' s leading psychiatrists , dr . maurice e . linden , director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health .	10.995878
`` when the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower ' ' , dr . linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous ' ' .	39.880085
in one extreme case , cited by a pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker ' s wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .	39.209766
to win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer .	62.336098
caught at last , he was sentenced to prison .	6.6188684
while he was in custody his wife divorced him .	23.112122
more typical is the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage counselor .	42.511513
this woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired ' ' for marital relations .	6.552161
to please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .	19.88014
finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .	55.7934
one wife , described by a new york psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly pta meetings and the thursday-night neighborhood card parties .	65.726425
after every money argument , she rebuffed her husband ' s overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .	23.2628
experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .	151.9271
the wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage .	35.45608
she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .	53.517216
the husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is `` don ' t rock the boat ' ' .	42.698948
sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .	60.999462
hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .	82.15028
more often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .	69.94554
some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .	49.102077
the wife ' s attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .	57.015167
naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .	21.990137
unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated .	35.142323
generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife ' s mercy .	47.64645
`` the pattern ' ' , says dr . morton schillinger , psychologist at new york ' s lincoln institute for psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night ' ' .	24.771408
no one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world .	27.598198
after all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as dr . schillinger points out .	58.53567
there is no evidence that these milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .	18.947437
furthermore , dr . calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around .	61.155773
they aren ' t `` frigid ' ' and they aren ' t homosexual	8.54664
they ' re just restrained in all of life .	58.0725
one such man once confided to dr . theodor reik , new york psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor .	11.703208
asked why , he replied primly `` because that ' s no activity for a gentleman ' ' .	25.616692
but such cases were , in the past , unusual .	348.26477
society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the bible appears to endorse the concept .	54.443623
family survival on our own western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man ' s strength and ability to bring home the bacon	48.109257
and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed .	132.76085
this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring life with father manner .	53.40976
in those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere .	82.7805
`` grandma wasn ' t expected to like it ' ' , dr . marion hilliard , the late toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the ' 90s .	15.27118
wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used ' ' by their husbands -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were .	71.207375
when did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ?	11.503162
some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .	57.08511
virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .	33.07822
left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .	115.11955
circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance .	85.22232
she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .	92.90085
she liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .	57.651962
`` very few wives ' ' , says dr . calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .	35.583237
a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well ' ' .	16.78405
and an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response .	71.89543
marriage manuals and women ' s magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .	26.453115
they began to describe in detail the woman ' s capacity for response .	23.268814
in fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , dr . albert ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior ' ' to men .	21.612757
according to dr . ellis , the average 20-year-old american woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .	52.341557
not surprisingly , dr . ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .	66.91273
yet , paradoxically , according to dr . maurice linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .	37.748238
an aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under .	141.48277
`` when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife ' s aggressiveness ' ' , dr . linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate .	14.291822
often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction ' ' .	1.2527033
one such wife , dr . linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .	23.507025
but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity .	83.66851
then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list .	13.209593
in some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .	90.98229
thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion .	97.26056
if his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .	70.13106
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up .	100.63237
on the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .	74.53717
or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .	36.412064
in any case , dr . calderone remarks , such problems are a couple ' s own affair , and can ' t always be measured by a general yardstick .	51.6924
`` as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates ' ' , dr . calderone declares .	36.877117
`` the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment ' ' .	33.690502
other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage .	75.1242
and just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband .	115.68861
`` to get a marriage back where it belongs ' ' , comments dr . schillinger of the lincoln institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .	33.61727
he must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish .	24.65876
he must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' ' ' .	63.45503
too many husbands , dr . schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they ' re doing ' ' , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play .	60.15476
she gave herself a title , lady diana harrington .	7.0186496
the new york d . a . gave her another , the golden girl of cafe society .	84.815056
houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute .	14.754676
and houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on september 20 , 1960 , `` diane harris graham , 30 , d . o . a . , circumstances -- unusual ' ' .	42.038692
early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor .	134.21854
she was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world ' s oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour .	60.94693
she never hid the fact that she liked to play .	13.120771
her neighbors in the expensive houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the golden girl of the mickey jelke trial ' ' .	52.3231
it was the trial of oleomargarine heir minot ( mickey ) jelke for compulsory prostitution in new york that put the spotlight on the international play-girl .	41.40172
( jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls .	30.097147
diane was needed as a material witness in the case and new york police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course .	48.93715
she had been moving in cafe society as lady diana harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns .	33.45074
it was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best .	65.91235
clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to assistant district attorney anthony liebler describe her to the arraigning judge	63.541416
`` this girl is the golden girl of cafe society .	17.207401
`` in 1951 she was a prostitute in new york county .	53.01578
in the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to france , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all europe with him .	55.26669
`` at deauville she met an egyptian by the name of pulley bey .	8.56793
he was the official procurer for king farouk , now in exile .	19.960243
she was in egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty .	135.9478
`` we have checked her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally back into this country .	48.017307
`` our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to jelke ' ' .	20.628223
i am not a prostitute , and i had only one very wealthy boy friend ' ' , she said .	30.185516
during the course of the trial , jelke backed up part of that statement .	165.92596
`` diane is the type of girl ' ' , jelke said , `` who wouldn ' t get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor ' ' .	33.88807
but she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends ' ' .	20.582191
she came to new york from detroit as a teenager , but with a `` sponsor ' ' instead of a chaperone .	23.593988
as she told it , `` he ' s a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 ' ' .	29.030628
she was mary lou brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive .	51.468575
she had talked her `` boy friend ' ' into sending her to new york to take a screen test .	38.416775
the screen test was never made -- but diane was .	328.95715
she quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business .	108.73791
she seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke .	75.35554
an ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` mr . warfield , the famous producer ' ' .	20.058716
the phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows .	83.70263
`` i ' d love to audition for you ' ' , she gushed .	6.0546446
the audition was held a few minutes later in somebody ' s apartment .	11.062949
she thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance .	80.574486
after a few minutes he said , `` i can ' t use you if you dance like that .	60.67867
i ' d like to see you dance nude ' ' .	8.218427
diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again .	93.92313
even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique .	295.1517
when the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` if you go home now , i ' ll scream ' ' .	16.639568
more often than not he would bow to the inevitable .	25.34405
one who needed no such threats was a french financier .	36.143288
one of the blonde ' s yearnings that he satisfied was for travel .	152.47787
she wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a french holiday .	49.86116
in an anonymous interview with a french newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her .	50.59929
`` then she went to deauville where she met a member of a powerful greek syndicate of gamblers ' ' .	19.848019
the greek evidently fell for her , `` monsieur x ' ' recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100 , 000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables .	50.778576
she could do no wrong at the tables that time .	46.012035
and in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way .	323.6432
smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to paris .	27.016628
no one ever learned what happened to the greek .	238.27737
the luxury of paris ' most fashionable hotel , the george 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to rome .	29.065866
she teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made nero envious .	38.49749
to climax her roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky hotel excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help .	29.328781
it was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night .	74.104675
discreet italian police described it in a manner typically continental .	53.559044
`` there had been a threesome at the party in the suite ' s bedroom miss harrington ( this was diane ' s choice for a roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known american actors .	88.63781
`` the actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent .	105.22854
the hotel staff , as well as residents of the excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall .	46.595207
`` they were wearing nothing but their scratches .	9.375488
the girls , after dressing , were indignant .	5.305598
`` you can ' t do this to us ' ' , diane screamed .	19.632835
in the morning she found rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally luxurious hotel ambassador .	18.507763
with the ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad .	412.48
of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do .	41.646458
by this time diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world .	37.4851
she thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in rome , she met pulley bey , a personal procurer to king farouk of egypt .	28.546692
a close friend of hers in the roman days described it this way	123.27579
she had a hard time making him understand that it was farouk she wished to meet .	66.59646
`` pulley bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him ' ' , the friend continued .	28.683226
it seemed as though she were always auditioning .	5.8807974
no believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see farouk .	15.365742
pulley had set her up at the semiramis hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key .	30.494286
she picked her own middle-eastern friends from the flock of ardent egyptians that buzzed around her .	46.121548
tewfik badrawi , mohammed gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of cairo society enjoyed her company .	130.14182
`` so extensive became her circle of admirers ' ' , egyptian police said , `` that her escapades caused distrust ' ' .	19.387337
the roof was about ready to fall in on diane ' s little world , but it took nothing less than the egyptian revolution to bring it down .	43.772667
when farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , pulley bey .	10.77054
they also called upon diane with a request for a look at her passport .	37.554947
the cagey pulley bey , who spoke no english , had taken the passport so that diane couldn ' t leave the country without his approval .	49.086323
officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the united states .	9.230869
and return to the united states she did , into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the new york district attorney ' s office .	22.558947
held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of mickey jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the women ' s house of detention , a terribly overcrowded prison .	25.977283
it is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the district attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at vesuvio ' s , an excellent italian restaurant .	52.701866
newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the district attorney .	30.420202
with the end of the trial diane disappeared from new york .	12.9258795
it was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` lady harrington ' ' .	10.977493
several years ago she married a houston business man , robert graham .	29.494179
she later divorced graham , who is believed to have moved to bolivia .	9.352142
houston police got to know diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring .	57.630745
last may , they said , she admitted being a prostitute .	52.35803
the next time the police saw her she was dead .	13.759088
it was september 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles .	17.091135
she had had a party with a regular visitor , dr . william w . mcclellan .	13.122702
mcclellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died .	55.13171
he had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time .	34.01175
when he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police .	86.80431
when the police arrived , they found mcclellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently .	64.60443
the blonde ' s nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her .	24.048761
pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls .	28.868382
an autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in diane ' s body .	10.491235
police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her .	55.915703
`` i think that maybe she wanted it this way ' ' , a vice squad cop said .	23.740437
`` a maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date .	93.977516
she was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens .	271.04736
at least she never knew what the bottom was like ' ' .	30.61764
i work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the east .	26.362352
we cater mostly to nice people in the $5-8 , 000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores .	28.412607
i am selling the stuff of which is made one of the great american dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting .	19.956118
there is only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream .	131.30638
from where i sit it looks more like a nightmare .	52.199127
they depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little .	133.41647
franklin d . lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs . claire shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in bakersfield , california , several months ago as a prospective patient .	27.355576
`` doctor ' ' lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes .	67.43933
then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .	40.965164
she had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder .	57.219406
( he explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it .	70.72186
) he knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator ' ' machine .	52.752148
as he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of mrs . shaefer ' s body , lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo .	33.170734
yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her .	89.40413
did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people ' s health ? ?	58.392796
the human body -- he pointed out , for example -- required 33 units of blue light .	144.68878
for that reason , he informed her , the lord made the sky blue .	153.3609
continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her	91.704315
this machine will cure your cancer-ridden body ' ' .	1.3056048
`` you didn ' t tell me i had cancer ' ' .	14.609118
but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about .	88.39453
why , i once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body ' ' .	21.826635
he urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300 .	45.24616
when she said that she didn ' t have the money , he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one .	55.204292
he then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again ' ' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away .	53.36104
lee renewed his pressure on mrs . shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day .	33.359596
after another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts ' ' .	29.339504
he then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine .	59.195347
when she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , mrs . shaefer felt intense pain .	20.192554
leaving lee ' s office , mrs . shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue .	65.83179
for several days , she was ill as a result of lee ' s treatment .	8.8728285
mrs . shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid lee some $30 , 000 for his ozone machines .	63.307785
for mrs . shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee -- and her friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection bureau .	98.85929
and she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of lee ' s quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend ' s clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting franklin d . lee .	26.280186
the charge violation of the california medical practices act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs .	22.536627
the sentence 360 days ' confinement in the county jail .	20.910547
rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases .	24.21711
the machine quack makes his rube goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals , wires , and radio parts .	96.000694
with these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people ' s respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age .	33.702763
he milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special buck rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer .	33.65416
the gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10 , 000 -- anything the traffic will bear .	44.00571
he may call himself a anaprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor ' ' -- or what have you .	21.512163
not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence .	61.49698
the medical device pirate of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear -- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines .	21.901289
his plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions .	30.941362
according to the food and drug administration ( fda ) , `` doctor ' ' ghadiali , dr . albert abrams and his clique , and dr . wilhelm reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10 , 000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines .	25.392677
authorities believe that many of the doctor frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .	65.40522
look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in cleveland .	41.635387
sarah gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and mr . a . , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast ' ' and the `` diagnometer ' ' .	17.51674
multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .	53.001022
you will come up with a frightening total .	24.980751
that ' s why the fda , the american medical association ( ama ) , and the national better business bureau ( bbb ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually .	25.941128
the postmaster general recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history .	40.414795
similarly , the american cancer society ( acs ) , the arthritis and rheumatism foundation , and the bbb have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high .	24.767044
for example , the bbb has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago .	70.32851
authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer .	98.83516
in this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative .	153.62659
the economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course .	31.588627
but it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away .	63.56993
by preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity .	69.65438
typically , sarah gross and mr . a both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their cleveland quacks .	103.42724
sarah gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her .	32.569717
as a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor ' ' was using were phony .	102.89484
she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized .	7.2839656
mr . a . , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple sclerosis -- and himself .	64.898026
mr . a has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man .	54.815212
`` that ' s a lot of hard-earned money to lose ' ' , he says today .	14.259339
`` neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor ' s treatments ' ' .	13.314033
and there was the case of tom hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what doctor fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine .	39.22667
after his pains got worse , tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung .	35.903614
yes , tom caught it in time to stay alive .	28.381308
but he ' s a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor .	71.40404
but the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering .	56.735798
in such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor fraud ' s cure-all gadget can prove fatal .	42.479233
moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide .	14.201664
in chicago , some time ago , mr . h . , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike ' ' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the vrilium company of chicago for $306 as a cure-all .	35.631508
`` hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have ' ' , said the company .	49.21687
mr . h . is dead today because he followed this advice .	206.92975
doris hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see otis g . carroll , a sanipractor -- a licensed drugless healer -- in spokane .	14.331092
carroll diagnosed mrs . hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic ' ' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) .	31.0717
his prescription hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water .	21.045517
although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water .	62.45797
inevitably , mrs . hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds .	17.698397
moreover , her husband and child contracted t . b . from her .	51.42226
( small wonder a spokane jury awarded the husband $35 , 823 for his wife ' s death .	15.89348
in california , a few years ago , a ghoul by the name of h . f . bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer .	37.423386
he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $185 each .	58.43667
when authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify he was dead of cancer .	47.415962
`` unfortunately ' ' , says chief postal inspector david h . stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court ' ' .	44.372406
that ' s where device quackery can lead .	30.298414
the evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands .	55.74593
who are the victims of the device quacks ? ?	5.116996
authorities say that oldsters are a prime target .	16.32505
says wallace f . jannsen , director of the fda ' s division of public information `` quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer .	23.976803
people who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks ' ' .	89.103615
the victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like mr . a . , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to doctor fraud ' s avarice .	41.421722
they are often ignorant as well as underprivileged .	5.3970785
ten-year-old richard stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year .	54.074776
his grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school .	49.487885
mr . and mrs . stewart were puzzled and concerned .	25.915094
then one day dick ' s classmate jimmy , from next door , let the cat out of the bag .	28.436619
the youngsters in the boys ' class had nicknamed dick `` bugs bunny ' ' because his teeth protruded .	25.842068
when richard ' s parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested .	39.904224
during the year that followed , dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance .	71.29391
`` the majority of children in the united states could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment ' ' , says dr . allan g . brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the university of illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field .	22.314682
what do parents need to know about those `` years of the braces ' ' in order not to waste a child ' s time and their money ? ?	49.319965
how can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ?	15.399462
why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ? ?	1.0198177
occlusion is the dentist ' s expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed .	79.94353
malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for .	97.025055
one main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth .	17.89921
a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion .	29.667484
these two basic malformations have , of course , many variations .	22.994776
a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions	75.72601
a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw .	9.199329
crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth .	10.034843
front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close .	40.49779
upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close .	127.81995
the eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs .	83.80966
second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row .	58.16864
contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition .	24.739723
however , this does not mean that a child ' s teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family .	28.918547
tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it ' s important to remember that there ' s a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits .	17.963436
it ' s perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old .	58.26122
occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster ' s teeth	116.51916
but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect .	44.744694
malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long .	67.868
if a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble .	71.08308
if baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place .	38.422897
every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth .	33.0509
some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed .	67.75528
in certain cases , as in dick stewart ' s , a child ' s personality is affected .	19.804062
yet from the dentist ' s point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons .	17.950558
bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots .	50.698456
this serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults .	52.25983
then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles , increasing the likelihood of rapid decay .	40.612236
`` for these and other reasons ' ' , says dr . brodie , `` orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth ' ' .	9.86293
the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system .	61.113503
because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition .	106.644035
badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping .	19.67998
`` most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 ' ' , says dr . brodie .	41.139503
in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy .	127.62335
orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw	42.627155
they are not anchored directly to the bone .	2.9233704
abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided .	51.624172
what can 10-year-old susan expect when she enters the orthodontist ' s office ? ?	9.56502
on her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and `` tooth prints ' ' -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws .	34.451424
if he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for susie an appliance consisting of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs .	27.97494
this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone .	15.798705
as the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved .	53.262794
this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster .	25.268135
`` if teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place ' ' , explains dr . brodie .	52.741447
`` moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child ' s face ' ' .	25.272625
during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear .	47.677425
parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay .	33.51963
when in place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered .	29.376314
next susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending on the severity of her condition .	48.402637
during these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth .	38.405613
susie ' s teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position .	84.48053
but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place .	35.316486
usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth .	17.472603
susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day .	30.553001
then comes the time when the last wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist .	29.473948
straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months .	39.28864
aligning all the teeth may take a year or more .	57.56233
an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct .	97.890495
the charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country .	12.910587
work that might cost $500 to $750 in the south could cost $750 to $1 , 200 in new york city or chicago .	46.588474
an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1 , 000 .	29.465376
`` factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner ' ' , says dr . brodie .	28.723707
to become an orthodontist , a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist .	47.293938
`` costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher ' ' , says dr . brodie .	18.419716
`` fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago ' ' .	17.498808
people today are aware of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field .	22.088287
most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years .	27.560926
in many cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee .	56.26532
some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents .	22.703428
growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists .	4.831826
dr . brodie has 30-year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children ' s births .	31.550835
`` in the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at	65.5988
now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent ' ' , he says .	21.903708
`` fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do ' ' .	20.121662
this knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment .	10.767122
for example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another .	51.672466
in the past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy ' s large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them .	64.608315
in other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment .	208.92856
the child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth .	65.36453
`` nature often takes care of the problem ' ' , says dr . brodie .	3.1388419
`` a child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity ' ' .	41.551434
that is why dr . brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist ' s advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early .	53.809383
`` both because of our culture ' s stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so .	123.16134
let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment ' ' , he urges .	42.40035
superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research .	54.57532
plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money .	57.578964
plaster of paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child .	77.93529
as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be .	61.886395
`` after your child ' s baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it ' s time for that first dental appointment ' ' , dr . brodie advises .	58.551
`` then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year ' ' .	43.685143
to help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things	31.791294
he can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth .	37.275497
if a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed .	52.90826
in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them .	94.23958
from time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him ' ' , who were `` on the other side ' ' , and reports what they are saying .	37.383953
after a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames .	90.81923
as the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements .	51.879223
there are a few prognoses of coming events .	8.371596
another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading .	55.537045
some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual .	166.61241
not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums ' ' in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased .	14.529677
in fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( esp ) , on this side of the `` veil ' ' .	20.846577
however that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons .	51.996933
perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans .	84.682144
they may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship .	34.613163
the mediums with whom the parapsychology foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control ' ' who speaks through an entranced sensitive .	78.02598
what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation .	99.84906
but it is not really only a conversation .	10.086508
many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind .	58.480377
he himself might not have been really aware of his own mood	23.469297
it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ! !	90.65991
most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on `` pre-conscious ' ' moods and to clarify them .	16.7384
however , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading .	87.4617
instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing .	64.20746
for this was to be a `` proxy sitting ' ' .	6.3522468
as was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive .	52.56313
dr . karlis osis , director of research at the parapsychology foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` new research on survival after death ' ' , spring 1958 ) .	66.02157
he remarked `` it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter ' ' .	40.500973
the possibility has to be ruled out that the medium ' s esp may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated .	29.16836
one way to do this is by `` proxy sittings ' ' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .	35.43126
if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions .	64.81904
all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions .	51.106396
sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings ' ' are used .	10.277882
here the absent sitter makes a `` date ' ' with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , asking him to `` come in ' ' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him .	40.104774
in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else .	26.749523
he gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator .	75.91753
as always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter .	21.653877
so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium ' s esp and the absent sitter ' s mind .	10.748553
it is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield esp can range .	133.22353
now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him .	35.558853
here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic ' ' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual ' s own case .	65.71201
if you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! !	59.433464
an interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit ' ' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? ?	53.412697
it is , of course , easy to see how `` j ' ' will mean uncle jack to one person and little jane to another .	101.41081
`` a journey ' ' , `` a little white house ' ' , `` a change of outlook ' ' , can apply to many people .	32.917816
and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one ' s own point of view , which is by nature so personal .	56.02889
one sitter may think `` a leather couch ' ' identifies a reading as surely directed to him	77.77669
to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , `` atta boy ' ' ! !	37.71988
to get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him .	50.088413
if he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame `` does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ?	124.06476
or am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience ' ' ? ?	77.61234
conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant	83.05961
`` he had four children , two sets of twins .	23.312967
after being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry .	69.164375
part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road .	12.937556
he died of typhoid in 1921 ' ' .	1.9384239
methods have been developed of assigning `` weights ' ' to statements	11.707544
that is , it is known empirically that names beginning with r are more common than those beginning with z	366.49872
that in the united states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox .	54.516502
so each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights .	98.87952
specific dates would be important , as would double names .	724.0319
various categories have been explored to find out about these `` empirical probabilities ' ' against which to measure the readings .	35.052513
in the parapsychology foundation ' s long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements .	24.569784
it is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself .	49.127815
or , on the other hand , are unlikely facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ? ?	170.36322
that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out .	16.3379
so , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator ' s name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as correct ( hit ) , incorrect ( miss ) , doubtful , or especially significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) .	84.5461
he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his .	311.05276
all these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the hits and significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter ' s own reading .	38.60026
that is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls .	180.19383
conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material .	38.57018
and there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated .	65.077484
in another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements .	65.73081
does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ?	200.0394
does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ? ?	78.957924
it is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her `` hits ' ' .	87.65107
now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream ' ' , where the sensitive is at her best .	72.702896
mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses .	67.371574
`` i feel cold ' ' , the medium says , or `` my leg aches ' ' , `` my head is heavy ' ' .	20.54953
or perhaps she hears words or sounds `` there ' s such a noise of loud machinery ' ' , or `` i hear a child crying ' ' , or `` he says we ' re all here and glad to see you ' ' .	26.509403
maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door ' ' .	47.153606
the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions .	26.929842
sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there .	59.59298
if pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer .	78.515724
if asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them ' ' -- some more vividly than others .	84.24428
perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all .	30.986698
even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another ' s personalities , moods , intentions .	58.59105
of course , there is an element of training here these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power .	104.84209
simply using it increases its intensity , i was told by one sensitive .	132.263
nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery .	126.07594
impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value .	317.05966
it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to translate these into meaning .	34.860924
if communication with an entity on the `` other side ' ' is taking place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism .	43.793472
during one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons .	21.508738
but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail	907.97363
taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement .	49.886932
in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained .	221.51256
though they are often heard clairaudiently , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols a slope to signify the name `` hill ' ' , for instance .	55.50882
one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name shietz was significant to the sitter .	51.246223
the farmer ' s life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock .	24.593573
livestock must be tended every day , routinely .	2371.2634
a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens .	50.548973
even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season .	46.6803
the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily .	640.3761
he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice	74.45962
such a move may mean a loss of capital .	90.239105
hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life .	16.462942
the farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night .	118.28038
frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .	100.42936
no matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up .	73.03229
it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .	17.785938
drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops .	113.33155
sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner ' s earnings , even into his capital .	79.508125
returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year .	154.36015
the high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis .	43.45336
land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .	105.11726
part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .	56.966904
if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high .	115.28908
a part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer .	61.594532
it will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment .	99.09929
he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn .	35.301243
there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job .	166.48946
the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost .	27.349747
this may be true whether the farm is owned or rented .	7.2647033
if the farm is rented , the rent must be paid .	19.941416
if it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of .	47.480244
a farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children .	30.741995
it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air .	73.019684
the children can do chores adapted to their age and ability .	120.81916
caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work .	51.411102
part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs .	57.178276
for some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income .	26.819595
it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health .	86.70747
generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city .	41.422474
the savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .	92.74306
usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more .	37.58632
where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same .	93.40455
a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .	27.851295
some persons consider the work on a farm recreational .	17.8502
for some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner .	73.82534
part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal .	36.295624
it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation .	21.96596
general requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below .	52.025494
specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 .	29.526861
three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs .	41.09638
you could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small .	136.14626
if you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you ' ll need more land .	46.677185
in deciding how much land you want , take into account the amount you ' ll need to bring in the income you expect .	86.56883
but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work .	63.748936
the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision .	299.6159
some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development .	51.141705
sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .	44.577522
when surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm .	36.403706
if you have a year-round , full-time job you can ' t expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help .	53.731987
as a rule , part-time farmers hire little help .	81.966576
in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .	59.56522
list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month .	28.109095
you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one .	71.28286
do not include all your spare time or all your family ' s spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work .	40.137856
if you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools .	266.4638
you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however .	36.222748
for larger plantings , you ' ll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating .	14.701954
if you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $300 to $500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) .	58.328045
these tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing .	43.07987
cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer .	17.845268
if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises .	137.04993
you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs .	46.156197
if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work .	34.491604
before you look for a farm you ' ll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake	40.78618
and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent .	10.903034
information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture .	41.64049
if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy .	63.62846
discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm .	75.72851
choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities .	51.048782
then if you change jobs you won ' t necessarily have to sell the farm .	13.142512
the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .	96.28575
obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road .	12.152545
if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby .	119.24377
if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city .	55.382523
look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes .	3.8262365
there are slums in the country as well as in the city .	9.85101
a tavern , filling station , junk yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value .	67.692856
check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them .	105.22162
find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality .	15.941312
if these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect .	162.2436
you may have to provide them yourself or get along without them .	269.99603
you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water .	23.94447
if you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled .	81.699905
a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden .	56.696587
pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble .	37.667713
the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses .	27.063961
is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? ?	11.871665
if you can ' t tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist .	179.504
soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones .	56.373817
small areas that aren ' t right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop .	164.67508
will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? ?	41.160477
how much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? ?	60.666233
if the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements .	43.281395
the value of the farm to you will depend on --	121.669235
the value of the products you can raise on it .	22.745508
the possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision .	31.545494
decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town .	85.675156
take into account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work .	34.083557
next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm .	19.43423
to do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm .	131.08374
list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year .	37.657593
estimate the value of the produce at normal prices .	13.570993
the total is the probably gross income from farming .	21.040876
to find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming .	51.353245
include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment .	83.862595
also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family .	57.222054
it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it .	123.04899
otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor .	133.84792
to figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way .	68.30447
everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge .	120.123955
for almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned .	16.754616
one who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers .	74.5091
the gruesome humor of the nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david -- nor the gratuitous sadism of ss officers .	68.66502
public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the german press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .	44.041637
and still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .	58.0284
most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant ' s department of jewish affairs .	54.480976
counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .	41.050022
would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client ' s chances ? ?	52.30195
those who feared `` emotionalism ' ' at the trial showed less understanding than dr . servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .	61.47933
interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the attorney general for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow .	56.412376
but there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new york .	82.28424
in each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course in moscow the liquidation of the old bolsheviks and the tightening of stalin ' s dictatorship	26.74196
in the united states the initiation of militant anti-communism , with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard .	5.400197
these trials were properly termed `` political cases ' ' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences .	47.31788
but what could the eichmann trial initiate ? ?	1.0071741
of what new course could it mark the beginning ? ?	26.43877
the eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future .	101.196
it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are jews .	46.711395
as such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message ' ' .	45.7763
`` it is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial ' ' -- said ben gurion , `` and not the nazi regime alone -- but anti-semitism throughout history ' ' .	54.686607
how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism ? ?	50.013733
and if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove eichmann a `` fiend ' ' ? ?	29.47614
these questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution ' s case .	15.266681
it might be contended , of course , that eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-semitism .	32.74077
but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment .	37.993813
in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument .	62.258953
one who could be linked to anti-semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the jew-baiter throughout the ages .	34.111065
shout at eichmann though he might , the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism .	42.620514
yes , he believed that the jews were `` enemies of the reich ' ' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic ' ' anti-semites	22.093296
but he believed in the jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .	41.660835
the real question was how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself .	28.778755
in regard to eichmann , it was to be found in the nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was made more virulent .	56.758205
perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could , as eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer .	176.25298
not through fear of disobeying orders , as eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitler ' s victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` well , let ' s try it ' ' .	39.320217
at any rate , the substance of eichmann ' s testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the ss , and though the prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to that extent .	43.458748
but if the trial did not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it .	78.24782
if anti-semitism was on trial in jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of eichmann ' s department of jewish affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of jews by non-police and non-party anti-semites in germany , as well as in poland , czechoslovakia , hungary ? ?	30.80645
the infamous wansee conference called by heydrich in january 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the german state , including the reich minister of the interior , the state secretary in charge of the four year plan , the reich minister of justice , the under secretary of foreign affairs .	63.29764
the measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government .	48.49175
heydrich , in opening the conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by goering which authorized the final solution as `` a complement to ' ' previous `` solutions ' ' for eliminating the jews from german living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation .	49.342148
in other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews was but an extension of the anti-semitic measures already operating in every phase of german life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .	83.458084
this , in fact , it turned out to be .	39.13988
since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling german industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of hitler ' s crimes	47.616142
whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .	57.371883
what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ?	17.102226
not in eichmann ' s anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning of the trial .	52.98409
no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had conceived their anti-semitism as an `` innocent ' ' dislike of jews , as do others like them today .	77.160126
the final solution proved that the jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .	40.71374
ought not an edifying trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere ' ' anti-semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? ?	87.04676
the prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-semitism ' ' among the germans which hitler `` stimulated and transformed ' ' .	23.702679
but if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over eichmann ' s head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it .	32.01005
nor did the trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .	63.423843
certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon .	43.732723
eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .	37.215546
do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the jews in germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ?	29.192183
the career of eichmann made the trial a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization fearful of being mistaken for a jew , he seeks protection in his nazi uniform	49.70763
clinging to the enemy-jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness	42.951916
once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him .	42.323833
`` is this the type of citizen you desire ' ' ? ?	12.292331
but though this characterization in no way diminished eichmann ' s guilt , the prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it .	47.22239
finally , if the mission of the trial was to convict anti-semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the final solution was aided by native jew-haters -- i . e . , germany , poland , hungary , czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- denmark , holland , italy , bulgaria , france ? ?	30.067726
should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their jewish compatriots from the transports ? ?	43.379547
wasn ' t this meaning of eichmann ' s experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ?	72.97496
as the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage , the trial of eichmann represents a recovery of the jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .	81.69282
only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin .	51.74045
it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to the jews of europe .	38.088634
it is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable	83.68934
most of the information elicited in jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .	47.512074
in poughkeepsie , n . y . , , in 1952 , a roman catholic hospital presented seven protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the planned parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff .	24.31264
three agreed , but four declined and were suspended .	65.94436
after a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 .	7.763151
the peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy .	53.042572
in new york city in 1958 , the city ' s commissioner of hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a protestant mother with a contraceptive device .	32.84302
he thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving protestants , jews and roman catholics that continued for two months , until the city ' s board of hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy .	25.277481
a year later in albany , n . y . , a roman catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood association .	25.248205
immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man ' s right to freedom of religious belief and conscience .	19.144676
these incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue .	53.546406
it has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies .	56.173
it has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .	50.917046
where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment .	8.536872
the time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation .	16.819086
the first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level .	97.62902
instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached .	39.69067
`` all too frequently ' ' , points out james o ' gara , managing editor of commonweal , `` catholics run roughshod over protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades ' ' .	41.912926
all too often our language is unduly harsh .	3.3602355
the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between catholics and non-catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning .	55.50231
instead of catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .	34.453888
family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring .	24.937054
pope pius 12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications ' ' .	43.644405
this means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring .	32.065258
these are substantially the same factors considered by non-catholics in family planning .	35.90768
the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons .	64.73311
the roman catholic church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning .	87.36533
catholics , protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used .	53.38921
the roman catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period .	57.819653
the church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author it involves no frustration of nature ' s laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them .	58.012356
with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice .	53.12562
there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement .	122.05619
the grounds for the church ' s position are scriptural ( old testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .	24.645788
the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods .	41.798294
the roman catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end .	18.605698
this conclusion is based on two propositions that man by the use of his reason can ascertain god ' s purpose in the universe and that god makes known his purpose by certain `` given ' ' physical arrangements .	61.66121
thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .	11.489249
moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by god , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception .	69.11262
believing that god is the author of this law and of all laws of nature , roman catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .	52.039337
let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between protestants and roman catholics appear to be irreconcilable .	20.25743
but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them .	53.14741
why is it so different in regard to birth control ? ?	159.27951
it is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof , upon others .	81.78932
it is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others .	58.427223
both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .	18.458843
consider what happened during world war 1 , , when the protestant churches united to push the prohibition law through congress .	89.90328
many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .	33.74682
with over four million american men away at war , protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public .	82.24074
with the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .	41.49734
the attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history .	14.999698
the so-called `` noble experiment ' ' came to an inglorious end .	12.397593
that tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society .	90.54884
that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today .	131.52835
up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law .	43.908978
this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian countries .	138.70247
today , the roman catholic and orthodox churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction .	173.79118
the various lambeth conferences , expressing the anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among protestants generally .	52.14382
in 1920 , the lambeth conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race ' ' .	28.742943
denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the conference declared `` we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage .	53.417515
one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children	29.345821
the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control ' ' .	11.764062
the conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .	47.30517
in 1930 , the lambeth conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .	33.586388
in 1958 , the conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by god on parents everywhere .	151.50641
many other protestant denominations preceded the anglicans in such action .	148.58629
in march , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the federal council of churches ratified artificial methods of birth control .	52.093147
`` as to the necessity ' ' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question .	40.677666
there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right ' ' .	30.055449
since then , many protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty .	49.59491
what determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive in general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .	86.73672
this development is reflected in the action taken in february , 1961 , by the general board of the national council of churches , the largest protestant organization in the aj .	23.200872
the board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning .	91.87699
it called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives .	63.722797
the general board declared `` most of the protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .	45.69493
the general protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception ' ' .	70.0287
an action once universally condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .	43.19519
this viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .	14.600487
repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control .	42.07841
for all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american people is clear , profound and far-reaching .	42.75993
to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred prohibition experiment .	43.103943
this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .	35.348816
conscience and religion are concerned with private sin the civil law is concerned with public crimes .	47.631344
only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .	50.43526
among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself .	37.904926
on april 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , discovery , weighed anchor in st . katherine ' s pool , london , and floated down the thames toward the sea .	18.327946
she carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the arctic waters of north america .	20.721766
seventeen months later , on september 6 , 1611 , an irish fishing boat sighted the discovery limping eastward outside galway bay .	32.000732
when she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation .	99.05719
the captain was gone , and the mate was gone .	16.831224
the man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .	21.720078
what disaster struck the discovery during those seventeen months ? ?	15.704914
what happened to the fourteen missing men ? ?	1.0285528
these questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time .	73.695274
for hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain ' s fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man ' s desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports .	34.88063
all told , they offered a highly confused picture .	52.667336
but since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information .	28.003687
not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .	28.510893
historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .	15.270121
first , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma .	11.8491955
second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on american towns and counties , on a great american river , and on half a million square miles of arctic seas .	49.906296
this is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine	54.27263
the sailing in the spring of 1610 was hudson ' s fourth in four years .	26.041159
each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from western europe to the far east .	146.5101
in 1607 and 1608 , the english muscovy company had sent him northward to look for a route over the north pole or across the top of russia .	39.19536
twice he had failed , and the muscovy company indicated it would not back him again .	142.7564
in 1609 , the dutch east india company hired hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the half moon , and supplied him with dutch sailors .	73.99744
this time he turned westward , to the middle atlantic coast of north america .	26.602383
his chief discovery was important -- the great north ( later , the hudson ) river -- but it produced no northwest passage .	126.52275
when the half moon put in at dartmouth , england , in the fall of 1609 , word of hudson ' s findings leaked out , and english interest in him revived .	39.357162
the government forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship .	29.7997
he thereupon went to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .	499.34314
by springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of henry , prince of wales .	25.027475
he had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .	56.169888
the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .	12.3247595
a century of exploration had established that a great land mass , north and south america , lay between europe and the indies .	74.75907
one by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .	87.26827
in fact , hudson ' s sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes .	168.34503
but there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north .	26.989079
nearly twenty-five years before , captain john davis had noted , as he sailed near the arctic circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides ' ' .	28.536823
he named this opening , between baffin island and labrador , the `` furious overfall ' ' .	5.401454
( later , it was to be called hudson strait .	30.4148
in 1602 , george waymouth , in the same little discovery that hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .	84.36355
hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway .	26.997646
even hudson , experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the thames .	95.508255
on previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain .	83.07422
on the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of novaya zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case .	54.145164
on the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between dutch and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic .	45.788624
worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before .	60.85223
of only one could he be sure -- young john hudson , his second son .	157.0325
the mate , robert juet , who had kept the journal on the half moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity .	82.81153
philip staffe , the ship ' s carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent .	24.499548
arnold lodley and michael perse were like the rest -- lukewarm , ready to swing against hudson in a crisis .	82.81047
but men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find .	72.23381
hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .	26.252523
it is believed that hudson was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was trained on company ships .	28.197924
he was a londoner , married , with three sons .	55.189
( the common misconception that he was dutch and that his first name was hendrik stem from dutch documents of his third voyage .	55.203182
) in 1610 , hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession .	12.513352
hudson ' s first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the thames .	37.972866
there at the river ' s edge waited one henry greene , whom hudson listed as a `` clerk ' ' .	43.69807
greene was in actuality a young ruffian from kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores .	20.603907
he was not the sort of sailor hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had greene wait at gravesend , where the discovery picked him up .	45.405537
for the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of great britain , then turned westward .	28.898441
poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` lousie bay ' ' .	29.0014
the subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .	13.623696
with hudson looking on , his protege greene picked a fight with the ship ' s surgeon , edward wilson .	19.001274
the issue was settled on shore , greene winning and wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to england .	99.681465
with difficulty , hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from iceland .	8.765209
early in june , the discovery passed `` desolation ' ' ( southern greenland ) and in mid-june entered the `` furious overfall ' ' .	12.442751
floating ice bore down from the north and west .	28.426138
turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet .	15.910742
the ship ' s compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic north pole .	36.332394
as the bergs grew larger , hudson was forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay , an inlet of the great strait .	30.773176
after finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice-filled passageway -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled .	30.220448
the trouble was at least partly juet ' s doing .	32.712006
for weeks he had been saying that hudson ' s idea of sailing through to java was absurd .	40.084797
the great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason .	259.14737
a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would sail no farther .	23.820051
instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( sir francis drake lopped a man ' s head off under similar circumstances ) , hudson decided to be reasonable .	36.90931
he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew .	41.58359
patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives .	85.17389
when hudson had finished , the `` town meeting ' ' broke down into a general , wordy argument .	37.14621
one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in england .	35.338737
up spoke carpenter staffe , who said he wouldn ' t give ten pounds to be home .	20.494345
all through july the discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands .	9.887239
on august 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before , so far as hudson knew , seen by europeans .	65.47562
to starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds .	21.573433
to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2 , 000 feet .	27.373087
hudson named the capes digges and wolstenholme , for two of his backers .	28.411558
hudson pointed the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called hudson bay ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the pacific .	50.987694
after three weeks ' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas .	20.571394
the great `` sea to the westwards ' ' was a dead end .	47.19855
this must have been hudson ' s blackest discovery .	27.761002
for he seemed to sense at once that before him was no south sea , but the solid bulk of the north american continent .	56.332973
this was the bitter end , and hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure .	51.66574
feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition .	106.09079
north and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day after day , week after week .	100.26299
hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to england through the `` furious overfall ' ' was again filling with ice .	19.382141
the men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking .	8.572957
once more , juet ' s complaints were the loudest .	7.9440103
hudson ' s reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty .	4.9455547
juet demanded that hudson prove his charges in an open trial .	28.147749
hudson , presiding , heard juet ' s defense , then called for testimony from crew members .	220.89615
juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward .	33.583088
hands on bible , seaman lodley and carpenter staffe swore that juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins .	21.708992
cook bennett mathues said juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship .	28.327255
others added that juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward .	13.434295
the new mate was robert bylot , talented but inexperienced .	53.210186
there were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves .	125.23274
the important result , however , was that juet and francis clemens , the deposed boatswain , became hudson ' s sworn enemies .	16.341589
as hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew ' s respect for him .	29.742554
once , after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather , hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed .	61.142273
just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .	39.225227
michael butt and adame moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured .	12.370915
the anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but philip staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe .	24.685772
thomas douglas , fifth earl of selkirk , a noble humanitarian scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river of the north .	22.50358
since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the hudson ' s bay company , he purchased great blocks of the comany ' s stock with the view to controlling its policies .	46.472557
having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116 , 000 square miles in the valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers .	10.4172735
the grant , which stretched southward to lake traverse -- the headwaters of the red -- was made in may , 1811 , and by october of that year a small group of scots was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay .	40.466675
thus at the same time that william henry harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of indiana territory and winning fame at the battle of tippecanoe , anglo-saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the north american continent to the west of the american agricultural frontier .	19.344364
seven hundred miles south of york factory , at `` the forks ' ' of the red and the assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in august 1812 .	31.98576
by october the little colony about fort douglas ( present-day winnipeg ) numbered 100 .	48.68198
within a few years the scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called meurons .	32.62055
the latter , members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the war of 1812 , had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of the war in 1815 .	24.43778
selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire .	31.895555
the mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 .	64.91041
it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .	15.628239
when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the scots , swiss and metis moved up the red to the mouth of the pembina river .	24.053705
here they built huts and a stockade named fort daer after selkirk ' s barony in scotland .	16.687717
the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .	38.003723
the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by british fur traders .	27.486572
for many years the northwest company had its southern headquarters at prairie du chien on the mississippi river , some 300 miles southeast of present-day st . paul , minnesota .	15.885865
when in 1816 an act of congress forced the foreign firm out of the united states , its british-born employees , now become american citizens -- joseph rolette , joseph renville and alexis bailly -- continued in the fur business .	27.698671
on big stone lake near the headwaters of the red river , robert dickson , superintendent of the western indian department of canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .	52.792088
his trading goods came from canada to the forks of red river and from selkirk ' s settlement he brought them south in carts .	49.94304
these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk colony was begun .	62.091473
in 1802 henry referred to `` our new carts ' ' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack .	46.629025
they were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .	82.023544
it was dickson who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united states .	26.947344
in september 1817 at fort daer ( pembina ) dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of sioux , he escorted to prairie du chien .	18.93112
during the trip selkirk decided that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern united states was the best route for goods from england to reach red river and that the united states was a better source of supply for many goods than either canada or england .	68.515945
upon arriving at baltimore , selkirk on december 22 wrote to john quincy adams , secretary of state at washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` missouri and illinois territories ' ' .	58.56526
this traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our settlements .	112.17823
the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected .	136.90088
in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the forks ' ' ( fort douglas ) and in december 1819 , twenty men left fort daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien .	25.959305
it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on mackinac boats .	55.44967
with these completed and ice gone from the st . peter ' s river ( present-day minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to big stone lake , across into lake traverse , and down the red .	26.061817
this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk ab1 , 040 .	27.677916
nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to fort daer for food .	20.562136
thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .	39.324375
activity by british traders and the presence of a colony on the red prompted the united state war department in 1819 to send lieutenant-colonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of prairie du chien , until then the most advanced united states post .	40.82713
in september 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the st . peter ' s river , the head of navigation on the mississippi , and began construction of fort st . anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , colonel josiah snelling .	24.797852
it was from the american outposts that red river shortages of livestock were to be made good .	17.834427
hercules l . dousman , fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien , contracted to supply selkirk ' s people with some 300 head of cattle , and alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers .	18.003984
bailly , after leaving fort snelling in august 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the hudson ' s bay company ' s post on lake traverse `` in the sieux country ' ' and reached fort garry , as the selkirk hudson ' s bay company center was now called , late in the fall .	27.105114
he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed swiss who turned their eyes toward the united states .	39.786938
observing their distressing condition , colonel snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation .	18.623716
as these swiss were moving from the selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota , dousman of michilimackinac , michigan , and prairie du chien was traveling to red river to open a trade in merchandise .	27.672571
early in 1822 he was at fort garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco .	34.597256
alexander mcdonnell , governor of red river , and james bird , a chief factor of the hudson ' s bay company , ordered such `` sundry articles ' ' to a value of ab4 , 500 .	22.684587
for its part the hudson ' s bay company was troubled by the approach of american settlement .	55.72504
as the time drew near for the drawing of the british-american frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the pembina colony -- its own post and fort daer -- was on american territory .	24.752851
accordingly selkirk ' s agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by october , john halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to `` the forks ' ' in rafts .	38.32721
`` i have done everything ' ' , he wrote , `` to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment .	45.391907
' ' despite company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village .	47.52754
they would attempt to bring supplies from st . louis or prairie du chien at `` great expense as well as danger ' ' .	22.467596
at fort garry some of the swiss also decided to cast their lot with the united states , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to fort snelling .	51.378426
the disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave .	8.159039
after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on october 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the red was five feet thick .	51.89492
in april came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-june .	33.900665
on june 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the mississippi .	17.34626
by fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about fort snelling , but most of them were sent on to galena and st . louis , with a few going as far as vevay , indiana , a notable swiss center in the united states .	27.429337
in 1837 , 157 red river people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at fort snelling .	38.59567
below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the mississippi river .	32.403587
at the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by father lucian galtier in 1840 .	47.791634
its people , including pierre bottineau and other american fur company employees and the refugees from fort garry , were joined by the remaining scots and swiss from fort snelling when major joseph plympton expelled them from the reservation in may 1840 .	34.1955
the resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of father galtier ' s mission , st . paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those selkirkers who remained at red river .	40.824093
while population at fort garry increased rapidly , from 2 , 417 in 1831 to 4 , 369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate .	54.231155
accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the hudson ' s bay company , some settlers went into trade .	39.51351
the company maintained a store at which products of england could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs .	47.05985
despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the fort garry merchants were trading with the indians for furs .	8.032141
in june 1845 , the governor and council of assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via hudson ' s bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the company ' s trade and power ' ' .	35.73737
to reduce further the flow of goods from england , the company ' s local officials asked that its london authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men .	59.141937
with their customary source of supply cut off , the fort garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the mississippi country .	52.663094
others carried pemmican from `` the forks ' ' to st . paul and goods from st . paul to red river , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the british settlement .	23.310537
this trade was subject to a tariff of 7 . 5 per cent after february 1835 , but much was smuggled into assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the london committee .	23.316835
the trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel .	70.37419
the letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor .	21.160852
indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of american literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray .	27.782078
some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive .	7.6868954
a confederate observed that the yankees were `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier ' ' .	7.397635
another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house ' ' .	67.799194
a third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide ' ' .	6.442252
one wrote `` ( i am so hungry ) i could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups ' ' .	20.373272
a second reported that the dilapidated houses in virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times ' ' .	165.7985
a third remarked of slowness of southerners `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god ' ' .	34.246147
still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget ' ' .	33.21566
a yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart `` my girl is none of your one-horse girls .	34.75421
she is a regular stub and twister , double geered .	14.010209
she is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and union from the muzzle to the crupper ' ' .	16.591991
a texan wrote to a male companion at home `` what has become of halda and laura ? ?	59.679424
when you see them again give them my love -- not best respects now , but love by god ' ' .	93.61434
william r . stillwell , an admirable georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the georgia department of archives and history , liked to tease his wife in his letters .	27.662619
after he had been away from home about a year he wrote `` ( dear wife ) if i did not write and receive letters from you i believe that i would forgit that i was married .	55.398872
i don ' t feel much like a maryed man but i never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if i should you must forgive me as i am so forgitful ' ' .	54.61851
a yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote `` i am growing so fat i am a burden 2 myself ' ' .	88.99954
another yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer `` now i lay me down to sleep , the gray-backs o ' er my body creep	50.213055
if they should bite before i wake , i pray the lord their jaws to break ' ' .	26.61279
charles thiot , a splendid georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .	26.064514
but he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine .	47.825966
near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` fall-in ' ' and the other `` close-up ' ' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of fall-in and close-up ' ' .	31.178091
the soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the civil war armies were an earthy people .	26.609755
they talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body .	12.747359
one of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea .	7.5510173
men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels ' '	8.562654
but a much more common designation was `` the sh-ts ' ' .	3.180165
a michigan soldier stationed in georgia wrote in 1864	13.947784
`` i expect to be tough as a knott as soon as i get over the georgia shitts ' ' .	37.310814
johnny rebs from the deep south who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the virginia quickstep ' ' .	72.34338
a georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea `` i have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days .	52.43138
it sowered ( on ) my stomack and turn loose on me ' ' .	20.108315
a michigan soldier wrote his brother `` i am well at present with the exception i have got the dyerear and i hope thease few lines find you the same ' ' .	47.971146
the letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances .	41.460365
save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table .	97.54606
most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee .	27.58114
in the south , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor .	50.45994
scarcity of paper caused many southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing , i . e . , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written .	75.97228
sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads .	40.584583
a yank writing from vicksburg , may 28 , 1863 , stated `` not less than 50 balls have passed over me since i commenced writing .	106.784836
i could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now ' ' .	26.699352
a reb stationed near petersburg informed his mother `` i need not tell you that i dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter .	50.105675
just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for i don ' t dodge every time ' ' .	54.13494
another reb writing under similar circumstances before atlanta reported `` the yankees keep shooting so i am afraid they will knock over my ink , so i will close ' ' .	115.256645
the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives .	35.119904
but fathers often addressed communications to their small children	49.501045
and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of civil war letters .	120.62142
rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the negro community .	29.296438
early in the war it was not uncommon for planters ' sons to retain in camp negro `` body servants ' ' to perform the menial chores such as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes .	37.067497
sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners ' families .	32.04645
unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home .	16.4127
owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century america , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling .	64.341515
occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in richmond , petersburg , washington , or nashville .	20.423397
an alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the virginia belles `` they thout i was a saint .	80.48909
i told them some sweet lies and they believed it all .	57.70191
i would tell them i got a letter from home stating that five of my negroes had runaway and ten of pappy ' s .	40.997322
but i wold say i recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk ' ' .	45.17565
an ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus `` dear sis .	64.762405
alf sed he heard that you and hardy was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse .	60.30795
i think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as alf dyer and let that orney thefin , drunkard , damed card playing sun of a bich com to sea you , the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion , he is too orney for hel .	26.435568
i will shute him as shore as i sea him ' ' .	27.775202
initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions .	236.52298
a federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in virginia `` dear pa .	20.08018
we got to one house where there were five secessionists .	22.444462
they brok & run and arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them .	27.309784
thay may say what they please but godamit pa it is fun ' ' .	20.84925
some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers .	17.59657
a mississippi soldier wrote `` our general reub davis is a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass ' ' .	11.853013
an alabamian wrote `` col . henry is ( an ignoramus ) fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn ' ' .	39.955574
a floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote guts to a bear ' ' .	13.940909
on december 9 , 1862 , sergeant edwin h . fay , an unusual louisianan who held a . b . and m . a . degrees from harvard university and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in louisiana , wrote his wife `` i saw pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke i ever saw .	34.815666
his head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps .	40.85221
jackson runs first and his cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader .	197.97113
but he is a west point graduate and therefore must be born to command ' ' .	63.230312
similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of northern soldiers .	23.197657
a massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a civil war version of bill mauldin , wrote `` the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks .	95.71099
they get all the glory and most of the pay and don ' t earn ten cents apiece on the average , the drunken rascals ' ' .	28.465733
private george gray hunter of pennsylvania wrote `` i am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago ' ' .	59.148678
another yankee became so disgusted as to state `` i wish to god one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against ( the other half ) ' ' .	85.16752
no group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors .	23.643827
one federal soldier wrote `` the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do ( c ) ters and offersey when this war is over ' ' .	55.998734
shortly after the beginning of sherman ' s georgia campaign , an ailing yank wrote his homefolk `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment .	32.08933
i insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that i had better die by rebel bullets than ( by ) union quackery ' ' .	89.89222
the attitudes which the rebs and yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred .	64.563965
the rebs were , to a massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey & gunpowder put into a human frame ' ' .	90.42402
a pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that ever i saw .	106.117
they looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings .	14.89909
' ' private jenkins lloyd jones of the wisconsin light artillery wrote in his diary `` i strolled among the alabamans on the right , found some of the greenest specimens of humanity i think in the universe , their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect .	47.615337
they recooned as how you ' uns all would be a heap wus to we ' uns all ' ' ' .	52.78646
in a similar vein , but writing from the opposite side , thomas taylor , a private in the 6th alabama volunteers , in a letter to his wife , stated `` you know that my heart is with you but i never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe , by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is booty .	28.347244
the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america .	25.668818
and the emphasis on nationalism in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world .	56.622475
thus , if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset .	21.326345
historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .	61.72198
1 ) every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions .	120.63241
what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred .	105.68988
2 ) as a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness .	72.42495
its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .	47.437504
one can apply these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the united states in more recent years .	40.038227
the popularity of local color literature before the spanish-american war , the steady currency of the lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are cases in point .	31.349865
nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of american life , that learned societies such as the american folklore society and the american historical association were founded in the 1880s , or that courses in american literature , american civilization , american anything have swept our school and college curricula .	62.90264
of course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century united states .	57.174786
yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street .	72.24328
it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .	39.89985
after all , the average american as he lies and waits for the enemy in korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen ' s comprehension and control .	59.183243
anyone ' s identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .	36.096245
such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes .	191.0934
in america , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .	173.6632
a heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land .	41.106617
but we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .	138.93414
parson weems ' s george washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting states .	31.957808
abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national constitution .	70.48623
robert e . lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy .	19.112068
and their roles are paralleled by those of patrick henry , nathan hale , andrew jackson , davy crockett , theodore roosevelt and many , many more .	27.79377
therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts .	41.28693
1 ) most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all .	39.613686
2 ) the concept that an `` american national folklore ' ' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend .	26.4527
folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission .	33.392826
it has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression .	11.861383
related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence .	45.200085
though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .	53.949596
in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this .	65.24825
enthusiastically , americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like paul bunyan tales , abe lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition .	50.100372
nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material .	47.81429
naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore .	65.237114
that much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .	82.4628
as long as his material is americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic ' ' to his audience , he remains satisfied .	101.59556
from all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore .	74.38942
on the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation .	56.102303
on the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western ' ' or colonial material willy-nilly .	30.9504
unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used american folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .	55.674683
after all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to american undergraduates .	164.71199
in addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever-expanding and changing society .	32.659336
for that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed .	59.966824
anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four .	31.040741
they have little `` esprit de corps ' ' .	2.1321535
the outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque .	75.00451
his love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he doesn ' t care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote .	13.917794
folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such .	157.74832
the amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field .	44.91734
he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream ' ' reasons that many persons hunt game	109.905846
and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .	55.843437
fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them don ' t distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material .	25.748802
but there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts -- one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth-century german scholarship .	86.9484
both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found .	28.59543
both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines .	27.92974
the commercial propagandist , who can ' t afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst ' s toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .	74.76848
his standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst .	88.47014
to both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .	40.00311
dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector .	62.53783
the knowledge that most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors .	32.491135
the work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience .	97.87663
publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material .	117.86449
the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in .	65.01644
as a result , most people don ' t have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is	58.886257
they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there .	42.35743
and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone .	61.520237
if one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american public .	72.01697
and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each .	91.073235
does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz ' ' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ?	35.15777
when the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? ?	163.84032
is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that was ? ?	172.89717
or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of american attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? ?	139.6257
when he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged .	40.030006
in the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale .	50.797707
robert frost , for instance , writes about rural life in new england , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems .	40.02033
this has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk poet ' ' , simply because he is a rural one .	44.86211
in the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than frost to being `` folk writers ' ' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material .	58.049435
stephen vincent benet ' s john brown ' s body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does john steinbeck ' s the grapes of wrath and carl sandburg ' s the people , yes .	35.334663
the last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass .	43.43592
folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .	182.15167
the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude .	91.23175
in fact , there is much evidence to indicate they don ' t care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits .	94.339165
nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for the `` good old days ' ' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the steinbecks and sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .	30.063871
as part of the same arrangement , torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the april election campaign , bestowed upon o ' banion a third share in the hawthorne smoke shop proceeds and a cut in the cicero beer trade .	61.77283
o ' banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others ' .	33.009296
he had a round , frank irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone ' s body .	26.405058
he carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands .	36.944897
he killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately .	9.739421
the police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them .	40.13778
like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol .	13.593072
he was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths .	10.206074
he divided humanity into `` right guys ' ' and `` wrong guys ' ' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under .	27.926468
he had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality ' ' .	12.000238
he walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns .	24.51307
landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly ' ' but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath .	12.13492
he was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as torrio and capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the chicago underworld , the roughneck king .	27.09554
o ' banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant irish plasterer , in the north side ' s little hell , close by the sicilian quarter and death corner .	44.57447
he had been a choir boy at the holy name cathedral and also served as an acolyte to father o ' brien .	44.419655
the influence of mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace	16.267307
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police-dodging , and housebreaking .	11.714907
at the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .	20.130564
because of this he was known as gimpy ( but , as with capone and his nickname of scarface , never in his presence ) .	40.023277
in his teens o ' banion was enrolled in the vicious market street gang and he became a singing waiter in mcgovern ' s cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in north clark street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out .	30.239021
he then got a job with the chicago herald-examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper ' s news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors .	21.413689
he was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer named gene geary , later committed to chester asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young dion sang a ballad about an irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor .	25.426111
o ' banion ' s first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to bridewell prison for three months for burglary	28.826366
two years later he served another three months for assault .	29.155102
those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .	109.38432
but by now o ' banion ' s political pull was beginning to be effective .	50.482468
on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10 , 000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle prossed .	16.737837
on one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a detective sergeant john j . ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the postal telegraph building	69.172424
the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $30 , 000 in bribes , it was estimated .	15.183765
as promptly as torrio , o ' banion jumped into bootlegging .	7.6426806
he conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the sicilians , but he had his huge north side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money .	45.04005
unlike the sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe-cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution .	15.735592
he was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 o ' banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state `` i always deliver my borough as per requirements ' ' .	103.94806
until 1924 o ' banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his north side domain solidly democratic .	126.888695
there was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time q . `` who ' ll carry the forty-second and forty-third wards ' ' ? ?	26.507076
a . o ' banion , in his pistol pocket ' ' .	4.9898524
but as november 1924 drew close the democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that o ' banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important republicans .	30.56256
to forestall any change of allegiance , the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for o ' banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay .	52.412373
the reception was held in a private dining room of the webster hotel on lincoln park west .	29.625504
it was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen .	18.505941
the guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of american civic life at this time .	26.313835
it included the top o ' banion men and chief of detectives michael hughes .	58.622517
when mayor dever heard of the banquet he summoned hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers .	31.104925
hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of jerry o ' connor , the proprieter of a loop gambling house .	25.637594
`` but when i arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters i had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , i knew i had been framed , and withdrew almost at once ' ' .	51.123142
in fact , o ' connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin .	17.39202
there was a brief interruption while one of o ' banion ' s men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip .	26.62081
then o ' banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .	14.374983
this dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says pasley , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth ' ' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` belshazzar feasts ' ' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels ' ' .	21.272324
pasley continued `` they became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 ' ' .	28.34563
however , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever .	113.243225
o ' banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better republican deal .	81.84523
on election day -- november 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes .	17.982046
the result was a landslide for the republican candidates .	3.9322975
this further demonstration of o ' banion ' s ballooning power did not please torrio and capone .	20.90588
in the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .	16.431744
he behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness .	26.856049
they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , yankee schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by dave miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with torrio and o ' banion , frank , a policeman , and max , the youngest .	22.039885
to settle this slight , o ' banion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop , where , he had learned , dave miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy .	27.107273
at the end of the performance , dave and max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .	18.065294
o ' banion drew his guns and fired at dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .	25.511372
a second bullet ricocheted off max ' s belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress .	20.370964
o ' banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre	55.602043
that sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of torrio and capone , was a nonsense .	30.492804
a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a torrio beer convoy on a west side street and demanded $300 to let it through .	80.83429
one of the beer-runners telephoned o ' banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation .	48.75839
o ' banion ' s reaction was `` three hundred dollars ! !	52.368103
why , i can get them knocked off for half that much ' ' .	81.0172
upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if o ' banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen .	28.296305
but in the meantime the beer-runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned torrio and returned to o ' banion with the message `` say , dionie , i just been talking to johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred .	64.34505
he says he don ' t want no trouble ' ' .	12.018634
but torrio and capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the irishman .	12.658083
for three years , since the liquor territorial conference , torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated o ' banion ' s impudent double-crossing .	26.523651
they had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in cicero .	148.69736
when , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the april election , torrio had given o ' banion a slice of cicero , the profits from that district had been $20 , 000 a month .	36.901646
in six months o ' banion had boosted the profits to $100 , 000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb .	26.517822
these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the sheldon , saltis-mcerlane , and druggan-lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the torrio-capone saloons	22.397886
once again o ' banion ' s brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will .	59.427315
the revenue from o ' banion ' s cicero territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the torrio-capone takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago ' s south and west sides .	51.91384
but he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate .	9.7263565
at last , even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that o ' banion should take a percentage in the stickney brothels in return for one from his cicero beer concession .	45.218445
o ' banion ' s reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .	50.861244
still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the o ' banion gang ' s seizure from a west side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of canadian whisky worth $100 , 000 and by one of the biggest coups of the prohibition era -- the sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation .	24.383125
here was stored $1 , 000 , 000 worth of bonded whisky .	13.52967
these 1750 cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the o ' banion men , who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water .	31.499891
a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption .	23.713957
the most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of krakatoa in 1883	26.523157
it raced across the pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of java and sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as san francisco .	27.561491
the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves .	21.675447
whether or not plato ' s tale of the lost continent of atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times .	49.97544
indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the arabian sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the biblical story of the flood .	14.956864
one of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous lisbon earthquake of november 1 , 1755	21.135666
its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the english coast .	135.7841
tsunami are rare , however , in the atlantic ocean	228.71092
they are far more common in the pacific .	24.134197
japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 .	17.84195
the hawaiian islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years .	132.73659
in 1707 an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the inland sea	47.498188
one wave swamped more than 1 , 000 ships and boats in osaka bay .	51.29616
a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been .	92.22731
in 1896 a japanese tsunami killed 27 , 000 people and swept away 10 , 000 homes .	33.93636
the dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement .	81.65235
an ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the atlantic or 1 , 000 feet in the pacific .	15.902663
but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest .	20.856226
while a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour .	20.996092
the greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave	72.55727
lagrange ' s law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity .	41.190018
in the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour .	49.205193
tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .	57.20994
their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest .	18.98039
usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights .	23.629238
on the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells .	62.422176
not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened .	31.002932
the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .	35.317986
the giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones .	44.483147
they usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a v-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .	19.141596
generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers .	56.898247
this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives .	29.112183
reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish .	16.3917
at hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach .	6.626491
many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore .	26.368788
after an earthquake in japan in 1793 people on the coast at tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground .	23.341743
when a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides .	11.793659
just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them .	26.911499
a tsunami is not a single wave but a series .	49.850582
the waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over .	74.08019
the waves may keep coming for many hours .	5.174855
usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest .	46.016293
among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at hilo was francis p . shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography , one of the world ' s foremost marine geologists .	7.752254
he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves .	25.226236
their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling .	9.504701
the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest .	77.42712
on some of the islands ' beaches the waves came in gently	134.2065
they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come .	52.97438
in hilo bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high .	19.8815
the highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at pololu valley .	65.62684
scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon .	19.942339
during a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night .	12.874422
the luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea .	9.893552
japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs	16.634789
the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance .	37.645893
the waves of a 1923 tsunami in sagami bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3 , 000 feet .	41.668766
gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands .	107.57848
the tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by commander c . k . green of the coast and geodetic survey staff .	26.060892
it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface .	65.1598
but when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit .	52.799347
this in turn sets off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress .	28.733362
such equipment has been installed at hilo , midway , attu and dutch harbor .	14.770127
the moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .	17.495634
this center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the pacific which are equipped with seismographs .	62.558506
its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami .	17.517467
by means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific .	53.916126
the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps .	73.533875
all of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .	67.82151
since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the pacific , but only one was of any consequence .	32.87379
on november 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula .	34.74056
at 17 07 that afternoon ( greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in honolulu .	9.693809
within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in alaska , arizona and california , the quake ' s epicenter was placed at 51 degrees north latitude and 158 degrees east longitude .	23.582022
while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific ( midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at honolulu at 23 30 greenwich time .	79.580605
it turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 .	42.13171
they hurled a cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows .	34.785492
but not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the hawaiian islands did not exceed $800 , 000 .	19.239304
there is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage .	181.24342
but it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough .	101.26667
in the vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves .	103.74583
life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man .	123.0109
the land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this .	44.633694
earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break .	266.73993
sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface	63.87095
often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there	69.26815
and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried .	131.73761
today ' s earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth ' s restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them .	39.519917
the effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized .	24.256124
the role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster .	65.94753
superstition has often blended with fact to color reports .	47.638363
we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth ' s interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled .	64.9554
these waves have shown that 1 , 800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core .	80.257065
earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths .	14.990023
two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .	5.0946984
( 1 ) as far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do .	128.28322
( 2 ) if earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? ?	68.74575
knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields .	17.32385
in the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources .	76.31878
we have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate .	70.95957
the following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book causes of catastrophe by l . don leet .	43.665627
at twelve minutes after five on the morning of wednesday , april 18 , 1906 , san francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .	19.664349
a sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll .	15.050683
in ireland ' s county limerick , near the river shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen , which means `` garden of owen ' ' .	24.715725
undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on american military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name .	62.038647
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes , sioux and apaches , mexican banditos under pancho villa , japanese in the south pacific , and chinese and north korean communists in korea .	35.151352
garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th u . s . cavalry regiment , `` the fighting seventh ' ' .	8.925491
today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables .	14.034956
but don ' t tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh , especially in a saloon on saturday night .	27.929382
of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than lieutenant colonel melbourne c . chandler .	84.43506
wiry and burr-headed , with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper .	14.861037
the truth is , however , that when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil .	63.800575
chandler had been commissioned in the medical service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make the army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it .	38.922806
though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces .	37.040264
the next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of troop h , 7th cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in japan .	24.821648
outside of combat , he couldn ' t have landed in a tougher spot .	11.683396
first of all , no unit likes to have a new co brought in from the outside , especially when he ' s an armchair trooper .	55.611195
second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him , it ' s on maneuvers .	68.32779
in combat , helping your co make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed .	376.83505
but in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it ' s easy .	55.686817
but his first few days with troop h were full of surprises , beginning with first sergeant robert early .	183.64352
chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice .	106.0258
instead sergeant early was quiet , sharp and confident .	10.180323
he had enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade .	267.78165
there was no weapon early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .	41.841125
he could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work .	116.58173
further , he had taken full advantage of the army ' s correspondence courses .	52.24635
he not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .	33.352314
but for all his erudite confidence , sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold .	122.5422
he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh .	7.777923
sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united states army .	33.835243
he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment .	20.41793
for example , it was a battalion of the 7th cavalry under colonel george armstrong custer that had been wiped out at the battle of the little big horn .	16.08508
it didn ' t take captain chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of troop aj .	44.58533
but what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment .	39.54095
maneuvers over , the 7th returned to garrison duty in tokyo , captain chandler still with them .	71.58619
it was the 7th cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the imperial palace of the emperor .	15.842402
but still mel chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word , `` garryowen ' ' .	45.48372
it happened at the st . patrick ' s day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an irish march .	46.897327
in the middle of the party chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen .	46.307858
the faces belonged to lieutenant marvin goulding , his wife and their two children .	36.873184
and when the singing began , it was the gouldings who sang the old irish songs the best .	32.701473
though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about marvin goulding , the jewish officer from chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no one really thought it was strange .	33.838333
for marvin goulding , like giovanni martini , the bugler boy who carried custer ' s last message , or margarito lopez , the one-man army on leyte , was a garryowen , through and through .	25.525883
it was no coincidence that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment .	10.227688
and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen .	3.7602222
he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment .	18.16347
one of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop .	52.05671
even the mess sergeant , bill brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range .	23.608145
the troop received a new leader , lieutenant robert m . carroll , fresh out of rotc and bucking for regular army status .	35.91767
carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that ra berth , and he wanted to play it cool .	46.588196
so mel chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before .	50.516914
when the korean war began , on june 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day custer had gone down fighting at the little big horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of leyte during world war 2 , , the 7th cavalry was not in the best fighting condition .	21.398266
its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across luzon in world war 2 .	63.513245
just a month after the korean war broke out , the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat .	23.510315
from then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in korea .	15.123679
one night on the naktong river , mel chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps .	16.865156
the regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side .	23.379204
the troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn ' t know when , and they didn ' t know where .	21.844835
at 6 o ' clock on the morning of august 12 , they were in doubt no longer .	72.22124
the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with russian machine guns , attacked the position held by chandler ' s men .	52.229176
first came the cannon fodder , white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram .	33.535824
they were followed by crack north korean troops , who mounted one charge after another .	121.898796
they overran the 7th cav ' s forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of their own dead .	77.93377
another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .	24.316357
captain chandler saw that it was building up strength .	109.459404
he assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .	38.088444
one of the more seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll , the young officer bucking for the regular army .	16.611263
chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight .	98.74067
he took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run .	35.27849
the first thing he knew the words `` garryowen ' ' ! !	4.770667
his followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran .	195.07416
the koreans fell back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire .	10.672334
chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran .	26.331408
it was bob carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of garryowen .	23.63914
he had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge .	73.01948
because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again .	34.432693
but an enemy grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously .	25.108826
he went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire .	16.419949
enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot .	215.65494
they found it at the junction between troops h and g , and prepared to counterattack .	27.773289
`` okay , men ' ' , he said .	1.9085485
goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` garryowen ' ' ! !	10.278764
but the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding fell dead .	38.39398
for an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead .	40.51906
then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` garryowen ' ' ! !	6.5553317
they charged into the enemy like wild men .	15.144957
that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant carroll had begun .	34.09504
goulding ' s platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack .	42.66504
reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by goulding ' s platoon .	35.507946
the north koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies .	22.029316
artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds .	34.200397
though bob carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived .	47.619354
today he is a major -- in the regular army .	42.641037
so filled was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment .	38.70251
after years of digging , nights and weekends , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book , of garryowen and glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit .	33.76152
the battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off .	67.99968
for nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment .	29.845469
take the case of major marcus a . reno , who survived the battle of the little big horn in 1876 .	17.459103
from the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus reno .	37.08654
many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him .	4.8404646
but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him .	39.095497
he was a member of the fighting seventh .	7.6471257
although it was at the battle of the little horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in american history , that the 7th cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then .	79.10825
brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiment ' s first permanent commander and , like such generals as george s . patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military prominence , custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare .	53.10488
during the civil war , custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier general at the age of 23 .	43.855556
he finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the u . s . army .	44.702557
i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them .	33.271214
if they were , walter lippmann would be writing the same columns as george sokolsky , and herb lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about .	50.573925
i do mean , however , that i take them for granted , and that everything i shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions .	108.89404
the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity	96.85112
and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states .	37.165382
i speak of `` the largest possible measure ' ' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around .	45.351654
these conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense i have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world communism .	131.9091
this is true for two reasons because communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions	20.62454
and because communists have the will and , as long as soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .	80.75253
moreover , as communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote .	34.440056
it follows that victory over communism is the dominant , proximate goal of american policy .	36.00437
proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive ' ' ends we seek , to which victory over communism is but a means .	127.152534
but dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it .	46.80131
but if we must choose between peace and keeping the communists out of berlin , then we must fight .	53.743317
freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective	35.368946
but if granting self-determination to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the sino-soviet orbit , then algerian freedom must be postponed .	48.665516
but if justice for bantus entails driving the government of the union of south africa away from the west , then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer .	53.553806
but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made .	39.918907
it may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism	21.910814
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of soviet communist power .	27.683018
this much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .	44.374893
this brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power .	117.33485
i submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .	61.589066
and i suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of american policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously .	92.78658
in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and i think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus .	45.478287
the other , for the most part , true .	155.50214
the first was that america had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .	101.29439
i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention .	35.457947
you may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- i certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all american strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of u . s . -soviet relations for the foreseeable future .	89.95465
i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those americans who have doubts , and i think mr . jameson campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth .	80.38913
suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the soviets ' position `` there would be more than 2 , 000 modern soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in mexico and the caribbean .	60.079563
overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast .	11.971188
half of the population of the u . s . would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people ' ' .	33.963905
add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity .	70.57781
add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength .	47.95929
if we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of khrushchev ' s nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage .	37.333584
the other charge was that america ' s political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years .	25.104725
the contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , i fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it .	88.90826
the argument was typically advanced in terms of u . s . `` prestige ' ' .	7.139902
prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem	12.184347
and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .	29.337019
prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill .	188.8635
but contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .	29.52909
only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be .	97.3515
the thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it .	57.83898
the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .	59.642155
this ignorant estimate , i repeat , is not of any interest in itself	77.72601
but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side .	123.25686
to the extent , then , that declining u . s . prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .	45.680946
still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves .	75.61845
here i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence , if you will -- about which the relevant questions are is soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? ?	139.062
and is western influence greater or less than it used to be ? ?	54.477016
in answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded the success of communism ' s war against the west does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests .	81.815575
success may mean merely the displacement of western influence .	20.979267
communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages .	14.824861
fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they could not win , the communists seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the united nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level .	33.60658
the soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against the west .	58.665016
thus , typically , the first stage of a communist takeover is to `` neutralize ' ' a country .	26.999763
the second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist ' ' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy .	27.194183
and this may be as far as the process will go .	220.50624
the kremlin ' s goal is the isolation and capture , not of ghana , but of the united states -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist ' ' mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the soviet foreign office .	48.514645
to recite the particulars of recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring .	55.961796
six years ago french indochina , though in troubie , was in the western camp .	14.201085
cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist .	81.972404
indonesia , in the early days of the republic , leaned toward the west .	29.39816
today sukarno ' s government is heavily besieged by avowed communists , and for all of its `` neutralist ' ' pretensions , it is a firm ally of soviet policy .	18.176981
ceylon has moved from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west .	15.801885
in the middle east , iraq , syria and egypt were , a short while ago , in the western camp .	59.937748
today the nasser and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west , are dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel	96.834305
in almost every particular follow the kremlin ' s foreign policy line .	65.45214
a short time ago all africa was a western preserve .	108.66939
never mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian self-determination the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west .	60.477654
today , africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging , it would seem , into the soviet orbit .	24.554235
latin america was once an area as `` safe ' ' for the west as nebraska was for nixon .	37.3177
one latin american country , cuba , has become a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast .	90.79425
in some countries the trend has gone further than others mexico , panama , and venezuela are displaying open sympathy for castroism , and there is no country -- save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where castroism and anti-americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the american cause .	54.594543
only in europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface .	128.62323
the strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in england , and even in germany .	21.411106
what have we to show by way of counter-successes ? ?	8.801765
we have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the iron curtain .	41.05585
there was the hungarian revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about .	61.05487
there was the polish revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to soviet interests .	300.36258
there was the revolution in tibet which we pretended did not exist .	11.419632
only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing communist power in guatemala .	80.99336
and contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures ' ' and `` world opinion ' ' to bring down that communist government	54.722267
we moved decisively to effect an anti-communist coup d ' etat .	29.19919
we served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery .	136.56244
the first rattle of the machine guns , at 7 10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear .	44.93062
`` sounds exactly like last time ' ' .	2.2890744
the young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven .	79.891396
the middle-aged man said over and over , `` why did i come here , why did i come here ' ' .	26.092587
amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , i heard the thumping of mortars .	20.76763
this was my second day in vientiane , the administrative capital of laos , and my thoughts were none too brave .	55.386646
better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick .	81.78519
chinese and indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters .	10.187139
hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby .	4.2951646
a woman with a small boy slipped in between them .	96.993
`` please ' ' , she said , `` please ' ' .	7.6870856
she held out her hand to show that she had money .	43.011253
the american newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office .	63.52245
had the communist-led pathet lao finally come this far ? ?	38.030537
or was it another revolt inside vientiane ? ?	1.0086863
`` let ' s play hero ' ' , i said .	14.0721445
`` let ' s go to the roof and see ' ' .	10.308233
there had been an eclipse of the moon .	1.9088452
a traditional lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms .	22.543655
the din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck all around .	91.28358
how quaint it all seemed the next day .	4.2773476
a restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks ' ' .	66.595116
but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later .	111.241684
and no wonder , for vientiane , the old city of sandalwood , had become the city of bullet holes .	44.64451
i saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets .	33.901237
along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered .	10.722645
in place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble .	33.52987
mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next door .	119.33143
what had been the ambassador ' s suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick .	13.595607
this damage had been done in the battle of vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( december 9-11 , 1960 ) .	72.32535
and now , in march , all laos suffered a state of siege .	30.827744
the pathet lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more .	117.17639
throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .	11.323347
`` and it ' s all the more tragic because it ' s so little deserved ' ' , said mr . j . j . a . frans , a belgian official of the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization .	24.151896
we talked after i hailed his jeep marked with the u . n . flag .	7.777392
practically all the people of laos , he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows .	89.63122
they look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls .	37.470654
nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are .	109.15631
they spread over an area no larger than oregon	409.69864
yet they include peoples as different from one another as oregonians are from patagonians .	24.442884
faith in the buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits	15.083107
and to live in harmony with nature ' ' .	1.4552681
`` precisely ' ' , said mr . frans .	3.7468622
he spoke of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest .	21.761745
the slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering mekong river .	3.4518902
shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside .	12.582391
for so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast .	86.72613
to many a frenchman -- they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti .	32.657482
yet laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe .	22.655622
the pathet lao , stiffened by communist veterans from neighboring north viet nam , were supplied by soviet aircraft .	28.084082
the royal lao army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with american funds .	49.855537
in six years , u . s . aid had amounted to more than $1 . 60 for each american -- a total of three hundred million dollars .	39.46016
we were there at a moment when the situation in laos threatened to ignite another war among the world ' s giants .	26.66844
even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ? ?	80.9519
to find out , we traveled throughout that part of laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the royal lao army from attopeu , the city of buffalo dung in the southeast , to muong sing , the city of lions in the northwest , close to communist china ( map , page 250 ) .	22.923943
we rode over roads so rough that our jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly .	26.64678
we flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn ' t crash .	21.805914
in the end we ran into communist artillery fire .	13.973288
`` we ' ' were bill garrett of the national geographic illustrations staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met	86.45012
boun my -- the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky -- was born in savannakhet , the border of paradise .	28.498404
he had attended three universities in the united states .	2.2560422
but he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of vientiane , including the royal capital , luang prabang .	18.564177
before the airplanes came , he said , travel in laos was just about impossible .	178.24335
alas , so it almost proved for us , too .	36.107037
to go outside the few cities required permits .	6.170197
and getting them seemed a life ' s work .	18.661425
nobody wanted americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts .	28.383661
we were told that to the pathet lao , a kidnaped american was worth at least $750 , a fortune in laos .	25.970991
everyone had heard of the american contractor who had spurned an escort .	11.104462
now pathet lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil american intervention .	84.01196
although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in french , we were getting nowhere .	52.76648
we had nearly decided that all the tales of lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the prime minister .	28.437962
could we be ready in 15 minutes ? ?	1.0198567
his highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off .	44.402565
and so , after a flight southeast to savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a jeep right behind the land-rover of prince boun oum of champassak , a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from texas .	20.67938
from his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a luger .	9.312134
with our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust .	47.368515
in keng kok , the city of silkworms , the prime minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .	14.518956
then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls .	78.58015
an hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary .	27.45592
more bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well .	173.95369
then off again , rushing to keep up .	40.287514
but our two jeep mates -- keo viphakone from luang prabang and john cool from beaver , pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust .	54.024612
together they had probably done more than any other men to help push laos toward the 20th century -- constructively .	68.32268
mr . keo , once a diplomat in paris and washington , was commissioner of rural affairs .	76.86067
john , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the london school of economics , headed the rural development division of usom , the united states operations mission administering u . s . aid .	28.446663
`` what you see are self-help projects ' ' , john said .	12.92867
`` we ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor .	58.525707
we send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs .	8.518683
that way they have an infirmary for $400 .	3.7538705
we have 2 , 500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools .	99.6588
`` our people have been used to accepting things as they found them ' ' , he said .	20.376202
`` where there was no road , they lived without one .	98.52277
now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence .	108.987076
that ' s a big step toward a modern state .	55.999485
you might say we are in the nation-building business ' ' .	27.55211
in the villages people lined up to give us flowers .	35.299904
then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine .	97.247665
the prime minister paid his respects to the buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech .	18.135036
the soldiers are fighting and the americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the pathet lao the key factor is the villager himself .	42.847385
but our stumping tour of the south wasn ' t all misery .	9.845626
crossing the 4 , 000-foot width of the mekong at champassak , on a raft with an outboard motor , we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze .	18.618584
briefly we rolled over a paved road up to pak song , on the cool bolovens plateau .	20.801619
the prince visited the hospital of operation brotherhood , supported by the junior chamber of commerce of the philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at pak song .	35.892796
in the village of soukhouma , which means `` peaceful ' ' , we had a baci .	11.318417
this is the most endearing of lao ceremonies .	2.338873
it takes place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions -- for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the new year , for any good purpose .	40.100876
the preparations were elaborate flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string .	26.95016
the strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) .	15.111056
the candles were lighted , and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables .	11.524281
i was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone ' s head , where the worthiest spirits reside .	42.143696
now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us .	27.064665
a man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body .	51.632027
those souls like to wander off , and must be called back .	264.7804
with the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power .	62.626553
then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists .	138.64288
these were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls .	59.76751
as we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to john cool and silently showed him his hand .	79.837166
it had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar .	22.244713
john said `` i have some antiseptic salve with me , but it ' s too late for that ' ' .	15.076
my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds .	17.809694
jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings .	2.1270604
`` being jewish gives you tremendous drive ' ' , a boy remarked .	7.130706
`` it means that you have to get ahead ' ' .	9.29247
when i pressed for a purely religious definition , i encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty .	59.159935
`` i like the tradition ' ' , a girl said .	24.860905
`` i like to follow the holidays when they come along .	68.74545
but you don ' t have to worship in the traditional way .	41.8822
as i see it , there ' s no real difference between being jewish , catholic , or protestant ' ' .	38.552315
another teen-ager remarked `` most jews don ' t believe in god , but they believe in people -- in helping people ' ' .	46.952854
still another boy asserted `` to be a good jew is to do no wrong	114.48548
it ' s to be a good person ' ' .	2.0151482
when asked how this was different from being a good protestant , the boy answered , `` it ' s the same thing ' ' .	26.46445
this accords with the study by maier and spinrad .	3.2466044
they discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this conviction .	33.405544
the most important aims of the jewish students were as follows to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent	64.10966
to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent	1.3083904
nevertheless , most of the teen-agers i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple .	29.919899
however , they were hostile to jewish orthodoxy , professing to believe in judaism `` but in a moderate way ' ' .	17.309149
one boy said querulously about orthodox jews `` it ' s the twentieth century , and they don ' t have to wear beards ' ' .	7.615399
the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers ' minds .	84.36178
`` we were brought up that way ' ' was one statement which won general assent .	114.39582
`` i want to show respect for my parents ' religion ' ' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of judaism .	34.47644
still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since i ' ll be living in a suburb ' ' .	36.66953
intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval .	76.63052
most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds .	18.75581
`` when you marry , you want to have things in common ' ' , a girl said , `` and it ' s hard when you don ' t marry someone with your own background ' ' .	34.453453
a fourteen-year-old girl from the middle west observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious .	118.10707
it appears that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would not travel on saturday and , in addition , required kosher food .	72.32618
another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only orthodox girl in town ' ' .	38.749462
this is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant .	78.11432
one of the significant things about jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented .	30.380991
sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning .	89.5635
this is substantially higher than the figures for the american population at large -- 45 . 6 per cent for males and 29 . 2 per cent for females .	31.571266
this may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town jewish boy .	36.997906
in their first two years in high school , jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams .	53.731667
however , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement .	43.09044
it is significant , too , that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts .	23.800404
the percentage of jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .	68.12531
the motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different .	36.80432
the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed .	48.73677
one of the significant developments in american-jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women .	70.397285
it is they who read -- and make -- jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them .	29.4888
in upper teen jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality .	25.075483
`` people automatically assume that i ' m in college ' ' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably .	20.559841
however , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college .	40.851707
the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student .	37.250587
she is even prone to regard the college girl as immature .	19.480007
one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost .	51.781933
this is particularly true in large centers of jewish population like new york , chicago , and philadelphia .	39.017483
what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish world .	38.253586
perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class jewish student .	27.54641
there is , to begin , an important sex difference .	795.81946
typically , in a lower-middle class jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college .	58.7469
first , the girl ' s education has a lower priority than the son ' s .	44.93606
second , the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son .	164.2202
most jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home .	93.6276
the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically .	21.24337
one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .	60.39538
brooklyn college students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school .	59.50975
on the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school .	49.73589
this is particularly acute for those who attended midwood high school directly across the street from brooklyn college .	17.764338
they have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school .	54.73278
at the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .	46.889313
`` it ' s people of your own kind ' ' , a girl remarked .	24.985603
`` you don ' t have to watch what you say .	34.704556
of course , i would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but i would want lots of jewish kids there ' ' .	33.316895
for most brooklyn college students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family .	35.14844
brooklyn college is unequivocally jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing .	38.82052
however , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents .	53.404755
and the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping .	55.37447
`` as long as i ' m home , i ' ll never grow up ' ' , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly .	13.0342245
`` they don ' t like it if i do anything away from home .	46.454376
it ' s so much trouble , i don ' t usually bother ' ' .	5.1940646
for girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive .	12.403564
parents will drive on friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting .	93.745544
a freshman girl ' s father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn college and demanded the `` low-down ' ' on a boy who was going out with his daughter .	25.780079
the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field .	44.219925
under pressure from parents , the majority of brooklyn college girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours .	280.95367
this means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature .	69.891594
a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex .	39.70795
the breaking away from the prison house of brooklyn is gradual .	69.84569
first , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights .	30.44996
then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of new york .	53.4842
it is significant that the catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of new york , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps .	48.75409
but it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- fire island , nantucket , westhampton , long island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously jewish .	29.978693
although brooklyn college does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in europe .	35.10758
in general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith .	123.05896
and acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school years .	62.072556
brooklyn college is marjorie morningstar territory , as much as the bronx or central park west .	40.100964
there are hordes of nubile young women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry .	13.721896
it is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate .	23.674803
`` almost everybody in the senior class is married ' ' , students say dogmatically .	50.671497
and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the house plan association ) that have good news to impart .	90.91377
these announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts .	38.65814
there are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity .	5.114761
`` witt house happily announces the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz of fife house ' ' .	10.861121
the brooklyn college student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models .	18.580338
the ivy league enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish continental fashion , or even in nondescript working class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down ivy way .	60.33873
the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes .	57.485283
among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking .	15.356379
brooklyn college is distinctive for not having an official drinking place .	248.73935
the fort lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college boys .	106.46813
this should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) .	86.63226
for galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste .	20.829187
this could also be used for any other skin irritation .	197.14516
or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts .	38.79634
`` female troubles ' ' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier	54.22105
at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation .	70.66109
bruises , burns , cuts , etc . , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too .	133.87447
bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak .	23.859936
( doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain .	109.15913
) salted butter was another cure for bruises .	4.233418
many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water	13.770801
the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts .	22.433746
another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter .	31.249474
`` butter salve ' ' or `` butter ointment ' ' was used for burns , and for bruises as well .	15.512192
this was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil	30.421356
when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled .	6.8632116
cow ' s milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly .	46.207916
one man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch , was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time .	38.042587
a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings , which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the `` heat ' ' .	28.921131
later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns .	129.39389
the results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known .	198.54922
to stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds .	23.038128
one old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool	53.49846
this would stop the flow and also prevent infection .	17.24172
my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds	30.809544
she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine .	58.929626
he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated	108.36678
a `` chaw ' ' of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing .	18.294426
or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing .	17.271696
one old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head .	27.401564
his brother ran a mile to get the father	9987.773
when they reached the boy , the father sliced a new plug of tobacco , put the scalp back in place , and covered the raw edges with the slices .	43.8142
then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place .	17.17204
there was no cleaning or further care , but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar .	29.389217
veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic .	17.942162
until quite recently , `` sterile ' ' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound	52.51801
they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated .	23.709587
tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound .	27.357159
one family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard .	58.33569
another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke .	28.563507
rabies were cured or prevented by `` madstones ' ' which the pioneer wore or carried .	17.810534
in 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in norton county , and one had been in the family for 200 years .	42.613956
another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds , then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker .	16.704504
while nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose , not long ago a nosebleed was simply that , and treatment had little variation .	77.40501
since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid .	81.54457
this might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ) .	30.299192
nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient ' s neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life .	16.78145
or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper , meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears .	27.1955
old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water .	74.18372
blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance .	92.616005
felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine	28.295002
this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part .	55.648006
as the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be `` killed ' ' .	24.455492
`` get a bite , spit on it ' ' was a proverb .	10.788906
yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings	38.3002
not long ago `` denver mud ' ' was most popular .	59.97343
chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived	43.039524
so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye , they buried themselves in the victim ' s flesh .	22.121353
bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests .	20.711924
ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing .	9.274394
for mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made .	30.783949
for wasp stings onion juice , obtained by scraping an onion , gave quick relief .	30.056639
a handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water	54.877773
mud was sometimes used as well as soap .	10.320731
just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings .	13.2864
to keep them out of homes , even in the 1900 ' s , was a chore .	26.33473
bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather .	40.204704
kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests .	12.0255785
at times pioneer children got lice in their hair .	8.908971
a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job .	52.620872
to remove an insect from one ' s ear warm water should be inserted .	131.83942
a cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye .	15.651058
as the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation , and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out .	20.241327
another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed	66.02604
the particle would then move toward the nose , where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton .	27.410273
shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations .	52.733353
for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth .	20.990086
itching skin , considered `` just nerves ' ' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt .	17.769766
winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped .	22.09583
to cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water .	37.131493
they drank half a cup of this morning and night , and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution .	50.446228
six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies .	36.363247
frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow .	71.62272
now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead .	44.40901
another remedy was oil of eucalyptus , used as well for chilblains .	8.08018
chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves .	137.70303
boils have always been a source of much trouble .	43.405617
a german informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice .	22.163687
another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree , steeped in water until it formed a sticky , gummy solution .	30.164768
another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns .	23.476028
one veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire ' ' .	23.527939
another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight .	41.710987
this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .	42.21749
one young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times .	67.84244
another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days .	18.354053
saliva gathered in the mouth after a night ' s sleep was considered poisonous	56.93635
wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments , and strangely enough many warts did just that .	56.44068
one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy .	17.287142
another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week .	43.70579
a simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way .	54.11454
one person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water	53.277718
another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily .	94.40343
another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment	100.07265
the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave .	20.606915
as the onion decayed , so did the wart .	16.770607
sore feet by calf ' s-foot , an herb from the pioneer ' s ubiquitous herb garden , or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved .	22.779882
leg cramps , one person tells me , were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard .	49.777863
this does give relief , as i can testify .	2.733158
one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps .	31.242352
pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient ' s waist .	18.42327
for sprains and swellings , one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief .	41.013012
except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one ' s dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him .	46.30926
in instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal .	75.2887
it may , on occasion , be anything but that .	151.4677
however , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine .	100.133125
again , by spreading one ' s purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad .	49.53286
this is important because , despite all the efforts of the french government , an appreciable segment of france ' s export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas .	32.34851
a good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them	51.195248
he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district .	55.70448
these are the wines the french themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in france virtually no one drinks the grands crus on a meal-to-meal basis .	51.383533
the grands crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them .	16.204052
and certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the grands crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown .	42.826817
there is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper .	10.621849
some of them are very delicious indeed , and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse .	80.036705
consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown ' ' -- are the requisites .	70.65933
especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts .	67.30899
most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and some other latin countries the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself .	96.03915
now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! !	80.9751
) is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all .	77.031425
this is the only valid , and extenuating , argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter .	33.41732
a really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the visigoths .	16.154278
faced , on the one hand , with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines , and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks , it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence .	30.417564
the one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money .	109.46478
only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains .	15.151353
wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .	39.66319
this is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort .	75.845055
it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal .	58.354023
wine stored for a long time should be on its side	75.39407
otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it .	3.72857
when stacking wine on its side in a bin , care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork .	37.328003
fat bottles , such as burgundies , have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props , such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood , to hold them in the proper reclining posture .	59.113632
too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects .	136.7758
the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it if it smells of wine , the bottle is probably all right	73.53489
if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion .	160.73042
seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine they age it prematurely .	82.99686
the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees , with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this , provided there are no sudden or frequent changes .	59.57406
consequently , one ' s wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces .	31.782692
if one lives near a subway or an express parkway , the solution is to have one ' s wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time .	48.6037
light , especially daylight , is always bad for wine .	51.23066
all in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking	212.6686
many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork .	47.487644
no one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! !	84.02198
but the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of paris and bordeaux and dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal .	41.91991
a white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes	23.248096
for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow .	23.872133
though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .	40.522964
but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full .	55.670227
in this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal ( or the course ) , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .	47.5968
the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire .	101.52713
this invariably effaces any wine ' s character , and drives its fragrance underground .	21.744703
it should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in magnums -- and slower yet in tregnums , double magnums , jeroboams , methuselahs , and imperiales , respectively .	18.836641
very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and allowed some air .	27.524612
white wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness .	51.697224
thus , sauternes or barsacs should be very cold	365.80124
a pouilly-fuisse or a chablis somewhat less cold .	6.1259503
over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive .	71.35067
the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .	85.74047
to quote professor saintsbury `` the last glass of claret or burgundy is as good as the first	33.33845
but the first glass of chateau d ' yquem or montrachet is a great deal better than the last ' ' ! !	37.023743
this does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good .	62.394238
if this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place	139.37326
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk .	17.399065
a few red wines , notably those of the beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature .	19.314018
by tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well .	61.609802
thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken	29.241772
very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself .	57.483746
a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea .	39.67945
the cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward .	12.977174
many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment .	30.71091
another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle .	48.347588
in france , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them .	45.217323
the wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted .	41.72386
it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy .	59.934666
for , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs .	55.96809
though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten .	91.12162
red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer	290.34506
the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red burgundy .	310.91385
some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more .	38.7131
if a red bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while .	80.00904
most of the wines of beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young	29.63447
giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically `` rest assured that your accompanying letter of instructions shall be in the letter and spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views ' ' .	65.46966
giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation .	6.6625667
the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under john palfrey ' s overseer .	77.54687
william , who lived in neighboring st . mary ' s parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year .	50.185036
giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation .	154.25633
if sold then , the land and improvements might bring only $5 , 000 .	42.95677
early in january , 1844 he had a conference with henry and william in new orleans , and upon learning of gorham ' s intention , henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother .	50.650223
the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless negroes .	25.728628
they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and louisiana law required their removal from the state .	41.32072
gorham refused to accept money for slave property , but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the north involved ? ?	96.146095
the suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic , since no planter would take the risk of having negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves .	47.905865
henry hid his annoyance , although both he and william were furious with their yankee brother .	141.90634
william , who did not write to gorham , told giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year , he would sue `` amicably ' ' to protect his interests .	43.707283
palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation .	53.412178
if william wished to continue operations for a year , why not simply leave the negroes undisturbed and pay them `` as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age .	149.04073
a disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme .	55.724113
their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement ' ' .	39.354412
when he heard of his brothers ' anger , palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages .	22.853851
if not , he was willing to accede to william ' s wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim .	61.835632
william was adamant on one point under no circumstances would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his and henry ' s slaves if they were told of their coming freedom .	50.361065
knowing the antipathy that existed in louisiana against increasing the number of free negroes , giffen suggested that palfrey bring them to boston at once , and then send them on to liberia .	62.587326
lacking specific instructions , he agreed to william ' s condition .	21.716183
in march there was a division of the slaves , and giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible .	76.36818
of the fifty-two slaves , giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females .	42.370823
`` i considered that your views would be best carried out ' ' , he explained , `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of emancipation .	68.3161
i have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of conscience & justice ' ' .	49.037186
the ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five , for an old house servant , to an unnamed newborn child .	40.022743
if palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited .	48.634476
this cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed .	107.11439
each human being , known only by a given name , had a cash value .	66.42646
old sam ' s sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150	30.575466
rose , a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential , was worth $400 .	13.5374365
in rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property , palfrey was giving up close to $7 , 000 .	39.32536
palfrey ' s brothers each received lots of sixteen negroes , and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6 , 666 . 66 .	28.846529
thus twenty `` black souls ' ' were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men .	24.305151
giffen extracted one concession from william the house servants could be free at any time gorham thought expedient .	52.7523
despite giffen ' s warning , palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in louisiana .	27.540918
yet even if he could get the necessary approval , fourteen of his negroes could not be manumitted without special permission .	74.32206
according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed .	32.536972
palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement .	94.86592
otherwise , freedom would mean removal from the state in which `` as the place of their past residence from birth , or for many years , it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain ' ' .	59.011063
on march 11 the louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition .	79.13206
news of the legislative veto appeared in the new orleans papers , and henry and william became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance .	49.12716
henry stormed into giffen ' s office waving a copy of the new orleans courier , shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair , and that it would reach the `` ears of the people on the plantation , and make them restless & unhappy ' ' .	30.090769
his brothers ' anger caused palfrey genuine concern , for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself to free his slaves , and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue .	64.52577
when giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey , gorham readily assented , vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents , his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him .	36.38249
in view of these difficulties , palfrey decided to go to louisiana .	15.597458
giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters .	55.319473
his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-april .	26.809202
palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for new orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of providence that he might be allowed to see his family again .	32.955196
during his journey palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists .	18.896132
in both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the north .	33.033394
in new york , lydia maria child welcomed him enthusiastically `` i have lately heard of you from the legislature of louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man ' ' .	66.29643
mrs . child , who had once apologized for sending editor palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of henry palfrey ' s slaves escape to canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in louisiana .	90.767456
she agreed to take charge of five or six of the negroes should palfrey decide to send them north immediately .	128.91432
at lexington , kentucky , palfrey consulted with cassius m . clay on the same subject , but with no apparent result .	48.169857
despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , palfrey ' s reception in new orleans was more than cordial .	17.938988
instead of the expected `` annoyances ' ' due to the nature of his mission , he received many calling cards and invitations from `` gentlemen of mark , on whom i had no sort of claim , & have had many more invitations than i could accept ' ' .	128.76295
he later told abolitionist edmund quincy of the `` marked attention and civility ' ' with which the new orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him .	35.848076
the memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and civil war .	70.23091
palfrey ' s autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of attakapas , `` many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans ' ' .	37.644394
he proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs , at least -- before the `` passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high ' ' .	33.914467
palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men , but not the women , to choose freely whether or not to go north for freedom .	68.23178
the women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage .	11.630445
he had a short private talk with each adult slave .	225.65617
only one objected , but palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others .	17.702314
all the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in `` their own little produce ' ' .	36.435146
the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account .	49.50838
william ' s threat that under no conditions would he allow `` freedom-conscious ' ' slaves to mix with his own was not carried out , for the plantation continued in operation as before .	65.63751
palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience ' ' .	95.65556
from cambridge , palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves .	14.512664
in fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased .	83.13937
should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , giffen was to provide passage at once .	141.81732
when a sailing date of march , 1845 was finally established , palfrey made sure that the negroes would have comfortable quarters in new orleans and aboard ship .	44.940605
giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the negroes with consideration .	77.87373
palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 .	202.73857
the plantation was sold in january , 1845 , and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months ' wages .	85.453575
giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year ' s work	13.298294
the new owner at attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement .	32.82392
on march 21 , 1845 the bark bashaw weighed anchor at new orleans , while on the levee henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their father ' s former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation .	29.237595
not all of palfrey ' s slaves were aboard the bashaw .	58.69381
giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants .	49.022373
two of these were included in palfrey ' s lot .	17.449242
giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves ( all more than fifty years old ) with the st . martin ' s parish police jury .	41.376595
after an initial rejection , which he attributed to a `` general excitement against abolition and emancipation ' ' , giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury , and got the permission without further delay .	28.000008
when the negroes landed at boston a month later they were , of course , no longer slaves .	32.560284
slavery was prohibited in massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780 , which declared `` all men are born free and equal ' ' .	19.306887
nevertheless , palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at king ' s chapel to formalize the emancipation .	8.59505
an eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway , and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free .	68.33783
once the question of emancipation was settled to palfrey ' s satisfaction , he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants .	36.366966
palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a negro boy in the hopedale community , but he had better luck in his other attempts .	35.718502
mrs . child , true to her word , helped place anna and her four children with a quaker family named hathaway near canandaigua , new york .	33.058426
this group had been palfrey ' s greatest worry since anna was in bad health , and her children were too young to work for their keep .	62.294823
but certainly the new frontier has brought to washington a group more varied in background and interest .	211.63652
secretary of state dean rusk , a former rhodes scholar and mills college dean , has headed the rockefeller foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange .	52.40714
one of his initial acts in office was to appoint philip coombs of the ford foundation as the first assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs .	27.38652
( `` in the late forties and fifties ' ' , coombs has declared in defining his role , `` two strong new arms were added to reinforce united states foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance .	52.56624
as we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm , aimed at the development of people , at the fuller realization of their creative human potential , and a better understanding among them ' ' .	38.128986
many of the new appointees are art collectors .	7.7953568
ambassador-at-large averell harriman has returned to the capital with a collection of paintings that include renoir , cezanne , gauguin , van gogh , toulouse-lautrec , degas , matisse , picasso , and walt kuhn .	7.8497577
the director of the peace corps , r . sargent shriver , jr . , a kennedy brother-in-law , collects heavily among the moderns , including kenzo okada and josef albers .	8.860205
secretary of the treasury douglas dillon owns a prize monet , femmes dans un jardin .	6.1555066
secretary of defense robert mcnamara , former president of the ford motor company , comes from a generation different from that of eisenhower ' s own first secretary of defense , charles wilson , who had been head of general motors .	39.687546
unlike wilson , who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism .	7.853785
an inveterate reader of books , he chose while working in detroit to live in the university community of ann arbor , almost forty miles away .	48.989223
he selected as comptroller of defense , not a veteran accountant , but a former rhodes scholar , charles hitch , who is author of a study on the economics of defense in the nuclear age .	21.28653
one of the president ' s special assistants , the harvard dean mcgeorge bundy , was co-author with henry l . stimson of the latter ' s classic memoir , on active service .	24.119371
another , arthur m . schlesinger , jr . , has won a pulitzer prize in history	13.572068
his wife , marion , is a portrait painter .	5.753827
the press secretary , pierre salinger , was a child prodigy as a pianist .	15.580128
( `` it is always of sorrow to me when i find people who neither know nor understand music ' ' , he declared not long ago in proposing that white house prizes be awarded for music and art .	87.108376
) mrs . arthur goldberg , wife of the secretary of labor , paints professionally and helps sponsor the associated artists ' gallery in the district of columbia .	38.844772
( `` artists are always at a new frontier ' ' , she claims .	19.492338
`` in fact , the search is almost more important than the find ' ' .	24.661343

postmaster general j . edward day , who must deal with matters of postal censorship , is himself author of a novel , bartholf street , albeit one he was obliged to publish at his own expense .	44.61831
william walton , a writer-turned-painter , has been a long-time friend of the president .	16.358355
they arrived in washington about the same time during the early postwar years kennedy as the young congressman from massachusetts	133.33748
walton , after a wartime stint with time-life , to become bureau chief for the new republic .	44.59524
both lived in georgetown , were unattached , and shared an active social life .	177.57097
walton , who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital ' s leading semi-abstract painters , vows that he and kennedy never once discussed art in those days .	61.929554
during last year ' s campaign , kennedy asked walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him .	38.74535
walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important new york city .	32.10426
walton , who served as a correspondent with general james gavin ' s paratroopers during the invasion of france , combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy .	30.573471
he provoked outraged editorials when , after a post-inaugural inspection of the white house with mrs . kennedy , he remarked to reporters , `` we just cased the joint to see what was there ' ' .	26.830355
already the president and the first lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging from the furnishing of the white house to the renovation of lafayette square .	15.104303
a man of great talent , he will continue to serve as a sort of presidential trouble-shooter , strictly ex officio , for culture .	25.23148
a more official representative is the secretary of the interior .	9.880234
udall , who comes from one of the mormon first-families of arizona , is a bluff , plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight .	27.378668
but even while sparring furiously with republican politicians , he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments .	46.93084
his private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as c . p . snow , arnold toynbee , and aaron copland .	48.345974
udall argues that interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves .	19.313553
after promoting frost ' s appearance at the inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of cabinet members , members of congress , and other washington notables gathered in the state department auditorium .	44.026917
the event was so successful that the interior secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the administration .	53.70654
his ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response .	452.0554
one tempest was stirred up last march when udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of william jennings bryan , sculpted by the late gutzon borglum , would be sent `` on indefinite loan ' ' to salem , illinois , bryan ' s birthplace .	29.28051
spokesmen for the nation ' s tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form .	47.88671
they dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a congressman , decrying the more than two hundred statues , monuments , and memorials which `` dot the washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans ' ' .	44.58946
hoping to cut down on such works , udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized .	69.359665
he is not likely to win this battle easily .	798.8378
in the case of the borglum statue an interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the secretary had no desire to `` hustle ' ' it out of washington .	28.139101
the last congress adopted seven bills for memorials , including one to taras shevchenko , the ukrainian poet laureate	9.1388645
active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first roosevelt on theodore roosevelt island in the potomac , and tr . ' s own living children , who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary .	38.419937
the hotly debated plan for the capital ' s franklin d . roosevelt memorial , a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches ( and promptly dubbed by one of its critics , `` instant stonehenge ' ' ) , is another of udall ' s headaches , since as supervisor of the national parks commission he will share in the responsibility for building it .	24.553568
`` washington ' ' , president kennedy has been heard to remark ironically , `` is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm ' ' .	51.277462
there have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation , commencing with the white house .	46.79418
one of mrs . kennedy ' s initial concerns as first lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine .	43.842728
ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by president thomas jefferson , the white house has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic .	49.906857
mrs . kennedy shows a determination to change all this .	61.847515
not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk , hewed from the timbers of the british ship h . m . s . resolute and presented to president hayes by queen victoria .	22.470066
it now serves the president in his oval office .	7.041982
later , browsing in an old issue of the gazette des beaux-arts , she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by president james monroe .	24.356554
with its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval blue room on the first floor of the white house .	24.078802
but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture ( which mrs . kennedy feels is the proper period for the white house ) must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms .	107.168175
the first lady appointed a fine arts advisory committee for the white house , to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them .	21.380728
her effort to put the home of living presidents on the same basis as mount vernon and monticello recognizes no party lines .	78.79097
by rough estimate her committee , headed by henry francis du pont , contains three times as many republicans as democrats .	46.234165
the press releases emanating from the white house give a clue to the activity within .	178.96616
a valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of benjamin franklin by jean-honore fragonard has been donated by the art dealer georges wildenstein and now hangs in the blue room .	19.598423
the american institute of interior designers is redecorating the white house library .	10.124605
secretary and mrs . dillon have contributed enough pieces of empire furniture , including dolley madison ' s own sofa , to furnish a room in that style .	29.238571
and part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware , bequeathed to the white house by the late mrs . margaret thompson biddle , has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the state dining room .	32.778038
woman ' s place is in the home man must attend to matters of the yard .	179.29416
one of the vexatious problems to first confront president kennedy was the property lying just across pennsylvania avenue from the white house .	56.453873
congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking lafayette square and replace them with what one critic calls the `` marble monumentality ' ' of government office buildings .	49.733612
while a senator , kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the belasco theater , as well as the dolley madison and the benjamin taylor houses , all scheduled for razing .	21.385393
what to do about it now that he was president ? ?	50.2159
only a few days after moving into the white house .	14.572324
kennedy made a midnight inspection of the square .	16.890844
then he called in his friend walton and turned over the problem to him , with instructions to work out what was best -- provided it didn ' t pile unnecessary burdens on the president .	60.369724
one of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged court of claims , diagonally across the street from the white house .	20.129057
but judge marvin jones , senior member of the court , is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby metropolitan club and desires to walk to work .	31.908123
more importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of sam rayburn , speaker of the house .	11.140209
there were aesthetic problems as well as political .	25.828218
on delving deeper , walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the square could be classified as `` early nondescript ' ' .	26.589048
the old belasco theater , over which many people had grown sentimental , was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a uso center .	51.318226
the dolley madison house , walton concluded , was scarcely worth preserving .	29.889555
`` the attempt to save the square ' s historic value ' ' , he declares , `` came half a century too late ' ' .	38.32385
surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful .	9.098891
the dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did .	44.79921
but his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures .	58.889877
he is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be .	46.50795
he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart .	84.309814
the men ' s shops on hanover ' s main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven .	35.197414
and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend , toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia .	79.95977
but there has always been an outdoor air to dartmouth .	102.87698
the would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment .	227.86163
no one here pokes fun at manly virtues .	2.565856
and this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the ivy league .	11.299063
thus , when dartmouth ' s winter carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , prexy john sloan dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o ' -shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a smith girl .	54.973206
president dickey ' s golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality .	25.098099
this carefree disdain for `` side ' ' cropped up again in the same television broadcast .	58.60569
dean thaddeus seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the carnival .	7.800918
she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head .	82.209885
dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid .	3.1391902
for example , groups regularly canoe down the connecticut river .	38.45421
this is in honor of john ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days .	62.895863
and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today .	3.0424805
they are hailed by the nation ' s press , and smith girls throng the riverbanks at northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses .	25.047424
dartmouth ' s favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing .	6.3929715
since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the united states , the students have stopped regarding the olympic ski team as another name for their own .	62.613773
yet dartmouth still is the dominant member of the intercollegiate ski union , which includes the winter sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country .	15.931995
dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door .	56.98663
they can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him , or move out to oak hill , where there ' s a lift .	26.367077
the dartmouth skiway , at holt ' s ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the east , ranging from novice to expert .	22.486444
forty miles farther north is mount moosilauke , dartmouth ' s own mountain .	34.087265
here , at the ravine lodge , president dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the dartmouth outing club to life on the trails .	62.647194
the lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room .	35.64102
the outing club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through hanover to the college grant -- 27 , 000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country .	38.181293
the cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips .	23.409555
the club runs regular trips to the cabins , but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting , fishing , climbing , or skiing .	28.36514
under the auspices of the outing club , dartmouth also has the mountaineering club , which takes on tough climbs like mount mckinley , and bait & bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a woodman ' s team , which competes with other new england colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like .	44.28067
there is much to be said for a college that , while happily attuned to the sophisticated ivies , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game , deer , or even bear is not uncommon .	65.33574
city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill , come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp .	30.018839
and on the summit of mount washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas `` because it is there ' ' .	37.77915
there is much to be said for such a college -- and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly .	66.87404
their affection for their college home has even caused president dickey to comment on this `` place loyalty ' ' as something rather specially hanoverian .	105.966965
probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the supreme court of the united states .	16.873617
early in the nineteenth century the state of new hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university .	64.746445
it fixed on dartmouth college , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered .	84.84155
the legislators decided to `` liberate ' ' dartmouth and entered into a tug-o ' -war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel .	39.336872
for a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body .	47.31928
the struggle was resolved in 1819 in the supreme court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history .	14.663647
in 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters .	14.493128
a lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for dartmouth daniel webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea .	39.875477
in an age of oratory , he was the king of orators , and both he himself and chief justice marshall were bathed in manly tears , as uncle dan ' l reached his thundering climax	49.97813
`` it is , sir , as i have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it .	48.571114
dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to webster ' s eloquence .	44.65335
this is not out of keeping with its origins , probably the most humble of any in the ivy group .	71.6792
eleazar wheelock , a presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor .	24.983906
eleazar , pausing on the hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first college hall , a log hut dedicated `` for the education & instruction of youth of the indian tribes in this land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences	101.17955
and also of english youth and any others ' ' .	3.64461
it was a hardy undertaking , and wheelock ' s was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness ' ' .	21.85669
a road had to be hacked through trackless forests between hanover and portsmouth to permit governor wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first dartmouth commencement in 1771 .	31.044523
the governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college .	24.755455
the exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gatherings .	112.47416
a student orator `` produced tears from a great number of the learned ' ' even before the punch was served .	47.900097
then from the branches of a near-by tree an indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the english language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue .	17.884434
governor wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines , and a barrel of rum was broached .	12.397885
the cook got drunk , and president wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself .	41.430454
future commencements were more decorous perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace .	128.16478
by the end of the nineteenth century , in 1893 , when the big three , columbia , and penn were populous centers of learning , dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine .	58.066216
the dormitories , including the beloved dartmouth hall , could barely house two hundred students in spartan fashion .	68.33515
then in 1893 dr . william jewett tucker became president and the college ' s great awakening began .	35.058914
he transformed dartmouth from a small new hampshire institution into a national college .	54.118126
by 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1 , 107 .	13.348862
and at his last commencement , in that year , dr . tucker and dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college .	42.454945
the presidents of cornell , wisconsin , c . c . n . y . , bowdoin , vermont , brown , columbia , princeton , yale , and harvard and the presidents emeritus of harvard and michigan were there .	14.919848
dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates .	24.2621
but it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside new england .	57.37839
over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class .	126.4139
only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation .	43.205246
about two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools .	24.204046
it is still a college only and not a university	40.15968
it is , in fact , the only college in the ivy group .	65.30014
however , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the dartmouth medical school ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the thayer school of engineering , and the amos tuck school of business administration .	33.63366
all three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred .	59.046837
all three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study .	116.11853
students of the college who are candidates for the a . b . degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year .	57.778034
the thayer school offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way , after a boy wins a b . s . in engineering .	44.569942
so dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the ivy group .	13.249143
it is still , however , the junior member of the league , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do .	68.16733
it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other ivies have enjoyed .	64.88463
however much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition .	69.1879
it has come on with a rush in more significant areas .	224.4899
today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking .	74.106514
but dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for lively copy .	55.817986
president emeritus hopkins once proposed to corral an `` aristocracy of brains ' ' in hanover .	12.513532
the person who left the buggy there has never been identified .	22.543545
it was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside .	17.729977
there are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against emma .	35.116497
she didn ' t like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage .	60.376602
she had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed .	180.12262
she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels .	130.12561
if she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her .	38.9891
if police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect .	51.169247
uncle john vinnicum morse was the immediate popular suspect .	142.46121
his sudden unannounced appearance at the borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him , although he clearly intended to stay overnight , if not longer .	62.87688
lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders , she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day .	38.946262
it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her uncle morse .	39.065353
at that time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s . phillips .	21.592426
a few years ago , not too long before his death , phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders .	45.734505
he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from lizzie .	94.73907
it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door .	118.44146
the new bedford standard-times has reported knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what borden said during his conversation with morse , he would have convicted `` somebody ' ' .	40.090015
notice , knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of lizzie borden .	26.70852
he said he would have convicted `` somebody ' ' .	1.9601732
it is known that morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at westport , a town not far from fall river .	46.771606
they were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters .	11.215549
fall river police did go to westport to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men .	115.110115
morse ' s alibi was not as solid as it seemed .	28.178112
he said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11 20 streetcar .	42.059326
the woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner .	51.98562
if this woman had delayed until after 11 20 to start her shopping , she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days .	53.871563
it is possible that morse told the woman it was 11 20 , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time .	74.6222
police did make an attempt to check on morse ' s alibi .	5.5063024
they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember morse as a passenger .	45.15641
questioned further , morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him .	42.53394
the conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so morse ' s statement really proved nothing .	113.72917
we do know that morse left the house before nine o ' clock .	12.803696
bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door .	72.49252
morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door .	37.326233
from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying , more than a mile away .	26.739353
he met nobody he knew on this walk .	7.0122266
there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs . borden was killed .	66.76491
morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , mrs . borden told the servant , `` bridget , i want you to wash these windows today ' ' .	24.520887
bridget ' s testimony was in direct contradiction .	3.0151792
she said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs . borden told her to wash the windows .	24.506008
this was long after morse had left the house .	56.693665
morse ' s knowledge of what mrs . borden told bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there .	45.999016
he knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone .	66.20886
and despite knowlton ' s attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum , this was not true .	40.669384
the screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back .	23.739985
it was unlocked all the time she was washing windows .	138.27634
morse could have returned openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied .	33.122486
mrs . borden would not have been alarmed if she saw morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand .	27.394867
he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm .	66.84114
mrs . borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out .	47.56246
he could have left for weybosset street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar .	120.59048
if he took an earlier streetcar than the 11 20 on his return , he could have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr . borden came home .	40.40805
with lizzie in the barn , the screen door unlocked and bridget upstairs in her attic room , he would have had free and easy access to the house .	23.219809
with the second murder over , he could have left , hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood .	59.019165
his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree , with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding the side door , was odd .	35.343132
there was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains , and certainly no scientific test was made of them .	64.14145
and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed .	72.5216
there was no financial gain for morse in the murders .	4.0465803
on the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying .	26.849993
the time would have been shortly after the murder of mrs . borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior .	47.220722
he said he had promised mrs . borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden house .	29.913944
what did pearson say about bridget sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ? ?	17.17351
`` the police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr . morse as in possession of guilty knowledge .	107.064644
indeed , it was probably to mr . morse ' s advantage to have mr . and mrs . borden alive .	16.186785
both he and bridget were exonerated by lizzie herself ' ' .	18.454937
that was his complete discussion of bridget sullivan as a possible suspect .	13.536427
although pearson disbelieved almost everything lizzie said , and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did , he happily accepted her statement about bridget as the whole truth .	118.29505
he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl .	57.094906
the exoneration pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but lizzie ' s expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of assistant marshal fleet .	25.718977
this officer had asked lizzie if she suspected her uncle morse , and she replied she didn ' t think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them .	28.779732
fleet asked the same question about bridget , and lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her room before her father ' s murder and came down when she called her .	29.741938
lizzie , actually , never named any suspect .	3.2633204
she told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner .	65.42371
and , much as she detested hiram harrington , she also did not accuse him .	26.315348
at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward , or who had bad feelings toward her father .	125.361435
she replied , `` i know of one man that has not been friendly with him .	45.825626
they have not been friendly for years ' ' .	4.116142
asked who this was , she named harrington .	32.551247
the press reported the same facts in using harrington ' s interview , but lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that harrington was the killer .	12.934123
when i interviewed kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the borden yard , i asked if anybody else in the household besides lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders .	29.714544
he said he had not heard of anybody else .	8.387867
`` how about bridget sullivan ' ' ? ?	1.0157071
`` oh , she was just the maid there ' ' , he replied , waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was .	61.773743
kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders .	28.332909
everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that , as far as we know , there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders lizzie borden and bridget sullivan .	36.608543
all the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as bridget was concerned , although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers .	41.204506
true , it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction , but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations .	49.115555
the actions of bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence .	142.09857
there are also other factors that require closer examination .	42.568653
the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle ' ' of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut .	72.36643
the people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of lizzie .	98.13899
if bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been lizzie borden .	55.946426
bridget was born in ireland , one of fourteen children .	114.98065
she was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time .	26.955587
she worked as a domestic , first in newport for a year , and then in south bethlehem , pennsylvania , for another year .	45.37278
she finally settled in fall river and , after being employed for a time by a mrs . reed , was hired by the bordens .	32.468056
i have previously described how , during the week of the murder , bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes .	42.434032
her father , james upton , was the upton mentioned by hawthorne in the famous introduction to the scarlet letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port .	38.22777
a gentleman of the old school , mr . upton possessed intellectual power , ample means , and withal , was a devoted christian .	34.064262
the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects .	54.520645
her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests .	108.83222
there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood had an unusual mind .	47.09289
she possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty .	47.173737
when she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited .	67.92495
she named 48 items , and said there were `` many more things which it would take too long to write ' ' .	36.681072
an essay on `` freedom ' ' written at 10 years of age quoted the declaration of independence , the freedom given to slaves in canada , and the views of george washington .	55.11321
lucy upton was graduated from the salem high school when few colleges , only oberlin and elmira , were open to women	50.098553
and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied .	20.536747
a picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , albert s . flint , friend of her brother winslow , and later , like winslow , a noted astronomer .	31.749374
he recalled lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys ' study hall to join the class in greek in the little recitation room beyond ' ' .	88.73796
the study of greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and lucy upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .	75.739624
the death of her mother in 1865 prevented this .	117.976326
with four younger children at home , lucy stepped into her mother ' s role , and even after the brothers and sisters were grown , she was her father ' s comfort and stay until he died in 1879 .	22.468609
but even so lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits .	48.027073
when her brother winslow became a student at brown university in 1874 , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under professor diman `` what is prof . diman ' s definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever onward , or does it retrograde at times ? ?	60.284344
do you think i might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you .	87.52073
' ' and that she proceeded to do .	18.548435
many years later ( on august 3 , 1915 ) , lucy upton wrote winslow ' s daughter soon to be graduated from smith college `` while i love botany which , after dabbling in for years , i studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school , it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing .	60.785496
whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being , that was my favorite study .	110.59052
she read maitland ' s dark ages , `` which i enjoyed very much ' '	28.42704
la croix on the customs of the middle ages , 16 chapters of bryce `` and liked it more and more ' '	39.776867
she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone .	76.792496
lucy ' s correspondence with brother winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies .	58.954895
also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately ' ' .	39.73102
who won is not revealed , but winslow ' s daughter eleanor says they got up to 1 , 212 words .	47.91708
winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him .	62.662582
at different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist .	26.898521
and it was lucy upton who first started the idea of a regular course in music at spelman college .	50.610584
winslow upton after graduation from brown university and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the harvard observatory .	36.718143
for three years he was connected with the u . s . naval observatory and with the u . s . signal corps	11.328949
and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at brown university .	21.651953
the six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to colorado , virginia , and california as well as to the south pacific and to russia .	32.779522
after her father ' s death , lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with winslow in washington , d . c . .	28.03638
`` their house ' ' , writes albert s . flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home ' ' .	33.203022
lucy was a lively part of the household .	19.516813
moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor .	108.7095
winslow , as his daughters eleanor and margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister ' ' .	29.516035
there is reason to suppose that lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother ' s death occurred just as she was about to enter college .	85.1035
as a matter of fact , albert s . flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings ' ' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country ' ' .	68.25326
while in washington , d . c . , lucy upton held positions in the u . s . census office , and in the pension bureau .	23.991854
they were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to germany with her brother winslow and his family while he was there on study .	54.65741
after the months in europe , she returned to boston and became active in church and community life .	53.435333
what was called an `` accidental meeting ' ' with miss packard in washington turned her attention to spelman .	40.613705
after correspondence with miss packard and to the joy of miss packard and miss giles , she came to atlanta , in the fall of 1888 , to help wherever needed , although there was then no money available to pay her a salary .	30.401209
she served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance .	116.16073
her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students	80.46441
of her `` great power of discernment ' '	1.0157071
of `` her exquisiteness of dress ' ' , `` her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers ' '	17.126772
her great love of flowers and plants and birds	73.26735
she drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world	42.647823
and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well .	43.556484
many a student was able to remain at spelman , only because of her unobtrusive help .	57.677864
under miss upton , the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption .	41.06857
after all , she had come to spelman seminary in 1888 , and had been since 1891 except for one year , associate principal or dean .	57.333076
she had taught classes in botany , astronomy ( with the aid of a telescope ) , geometry , and psychology .	20.337101
miss upton and miss packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common .	52.14577
and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and christian zeal .	39.124462
both loved the out-of-doors , including mountain climbing and horseback riding .	3.2525504
in 1890 when the trip to europe and the holy land was arranged for miss packard , it was miss upton who planned the trip , and `` with rare executive ability ' ' bore the brunt of `` the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end ' ' .	59.251602
so strenuous it was physically , with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both miss packard and miss upton .	29.509182
at the fifteenth anniversary ( 1896 ) as already quoted , miss upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future as a college of first rank , with expanding and unlimited horizons .	63.231697
when dr . wallace buttrick , wise in his judgment of people , declined to have the science building named for him , he wrote miss tapley ( april 7 , 1923 ) `` if you had asked me , i think i would have suggested that you name the building for miss upton .	60.281555
her services to the school for many years were of a very high character , and i have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her ' ' .	57.497917
such were the qualities of the acting-president of the seminary after the death of miss giles .	22.749191
at the meeting of the board of trustees , on march 3 , 1910 , miss upton presented the annual report of the president .	21.572847
she noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence	575.75977
that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired	443.58044
and that the year ' s work had gone forward smoothly .	11.035779
she urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission .	24.302689
the raising of the $25 , 000 improvement fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration ' ' held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to miss giles .	47.698895
with the fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid	34.777496
and ground had been broken for the superintendent ' s home .	7.169174
miss upton spoke gratefully of the response of spelman graduates and negro friends in helping to raise the fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses .	57.02335
she spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results .	120.96488
two bequests were recorded one of $200 under the will of mrs . harriet a . copp of los angeles	40.025585
and one of $2 , 000 under the will of miss celia l . brett of hamilton , new york , a friend from the early days .	32.75571
miss upton told the trustees that the death of miss giles was `` the sorest grief ' ' the seminary had ever been called upon to bear .	17.418839
the daughters of spelman , she said , had never known or thought of spelman without her .	285.16043
the removal of miss packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow , but they still had miss giles .	66.34969
`` yet spelman has strong , deep roots , and will live for the blessing of generations to come ' ' .	19.181334
miss mary jane packard , sophia ' s half-sister , became ill in march , 1910	12.656399
and when school closed , she was unable to travel to massachusetts .	29.320078
before coming on a visit to spelman in 1885 , miss mary had been a successful teacher in worcester , and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period .	46.343796
she helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping .	39.813316
soon the office work claimed all her time .	5.751605
she was closely associated with the founders in all their trials and hardships .	58.654587
quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary .	113.04301
miss giles always used to refer to her as `` sister ' ' .	5.7068233
she served as secretary in the seminary office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and bookkeeping .	30.780313
the books of the school hold a memorial to her	172.43077
and so do the hearts of students and of teachers .	36.234726
mary j . packard , states a messenger editorial , was `` efficient , pains-taking , self-effacing , loving , radiating the spirit of her master .	20.506355
with infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer .	101.41013
in a few school districts one finds a link between school and job .	83.0263
in those vocational programs organized with smith-hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other .	49.41242
in these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 .	49.188587
the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school .	40.842285
these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work .	17.283407
formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation .	62.48755
the `` diversified occupations ' ' program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers .	55.589424
the `` distributive education ' ' program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields .	43.60852
in both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half .	81.47574
in a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation .	56.682934
adult education courses , work-study programs of various sorts -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth .	68.19304
in general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next .	59.926003
if the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete .	45.02092
when there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well .	140.60623
indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work .	79.879814
statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one .	48.586285
i make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .	45.435078
he may or may not be `` better off ' ' than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school .	51.60369
but in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent .	59.0206
in a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , i shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found .	41.373627
in the negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation .	41.276726
high motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work .	157.36696
undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the negro schools .	52.983864
however , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual .	36.27385
and the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership .	38.392147
this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern universities .	15.816324
quite the contrary , as i can testify from personal experience as a former university president .	144.47064
the absence of successful negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic careers .	63.152393
i believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized .	96.24944
here again we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designated as negroes in the press .	45.280144
how can the vicious circle be broken ? ?	1.0074446
this is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both negro and white , should devote far more attention .	74.229836
it is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the south .	29.806543
i should like to underline four points i made in my first report with respect to vocational education .	46.570374
first and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation .	73.61008
second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student ' s time in those years	56.424374
however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier .	93.10591
third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work	44.993267
they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time .	27.4013
fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .	19.617315
this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .	56.02726
vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore ' ' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .	64.72413
those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .	55.55948
i have been using the word `` vocational ' ' as a layman would at first sight think it should be used .	43.09465
i intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .	80.64052
these courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic ' ' .	60.57474
practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill .	40.430885
they are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school .	16.844978
to be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status .	76.7672
similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school .	59.762295
of course , it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill .	42.273037
so , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics .	17.086061
in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained .	81.56191
in spite of the shading of one type of course into another , i believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses .	61.13213
perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule .	45.555195
today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school .	50.84632
most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools .	62.239006
in this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts .	51.439106
the neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school .	49.02678
indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs .	54.09234
he prefers to designate such schools as `` general ' ' high schools .	14.443249
the suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs .	42.08998
the reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .	11.489307
therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report .	50.527805
the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions .	23.718843
by and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system .	35.92276
it is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .	138.01863
one has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` i want to be a plumber ' ' , and then , by doing good work , find a job .	33.155376
it is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation .	84.83625
two stories will illustrate what i have in mind .	9.675427
one vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city .	59.277176
in the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can ' t get in .	86.91764
in a far distant part of the united states , i was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work .	42.18456
`` what does he have in mind to do when he graduates ' ' ? ?	21.784311
`` oh , he ' ll be a plumber ' ' , came the answer .	13.278088
`` but isn ' t it almost impossible to get into the union ' ' ? ?	15.332284
`` he ' ll have no difficulty ' ' , i was told .	9.715982
`` he has very good connections ' ' .	2.1501243
in my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .	121.574776
ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest .	60.105095
an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the dunbar vocational high school in chicago .	32.130116
located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students .	66.62837
hardly a window has been broken since dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ) .	80.040146
i discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were negroes .	105.35492
they were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto mechanics , and airplane mechanics .	11.5657835
the physical facilities at dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils .	37.517467
the soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world .	23.736696
in the united states , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil .	15.568122
the residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds .	26.27449
soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the orient .	17.606417
american chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of indonesia .	35.9679
soybean flour , grits , flakes , `` milk ' ' , and curd can be bought in the united states .	10.283792
peanuts are the world ' s second most important legume .	12.971455
we produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed .	47.66972
blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off .	50.236904
cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of asia and africa .	16.775621
in western europe and north america , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed .	35.884666
rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats .	10.195392
people depend less on seeds for foods in australia , new zealand , and argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high .	27.625315
feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world ' s cereal crop in 1957-1958 .	11.567615
most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry .	11.366186
about 90 percent of the corn used in the united states is fed to animals .	17.273544
the rest is used for human food and industrial products .	21.641188
more than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock .	13.819235
more than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the united states .	14.5392
the efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the united states since the 1930 ' s and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil .	23.573605
the demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops .	55.30934
seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position .	79.077065
chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds -- flax , castor , tung ( nuts from the china wood-oil tree ) , perilla ( from an oriental mint ) , and oiticica ( from a brazilian tree ) .	12.2167425
oils , or liquid fats , from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal .	13.670114
these oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances .	21.290194
the artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages .	49.958584
one of the finest of artists ' oils comes from poppy seeds .	22.511553
seeds of soybean , cotton , corn , sesame , and rape yield semidrying oils .	9.874276
some are used in paints along with drying oils .	40.663624
palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin .	12.978003
castor oil , made from castorbeans , has gone out of style as a medicine .	99.43228
this nondrying oil , however , is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant , as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment , and as a source of chemicals to make plastics .	29.23224
almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances .	13.574016
it is still used in drugs and cosmetics , but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds .	16.5833
liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives .	33.063557
sizable amounts of soybean , coconut , and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps , detergents , and paint resins .	19.669937
solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree , the shea tree , and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries .	12.156289
seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world .	37.30529
corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the united states , canada , and australia .	12.006393
in other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region , starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch .	24.70707
starch is used in the paper , textile , and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations .	16.621014
gums were extracted from quince , psyllium ( fleawort ) , flax , and locust ( carob ) seeds in ancient times .	9.270512
today the yearly import into the united states of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds	15.685303
of psyllium seed , more than 2 . 6 million .	22.982674
the discovery during the second world war that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western asia and initiated it in the united states .	22.44399
water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners , stabilizers , or dispersing agents .	16.884058
guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream .	2.2803104
quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions .	6.6511436
once regarded as an agricultural nuisance , psyllium was sold in the 1930 ' s as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands .	21.28223
locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper .	16.365965
the seeds of hard , fibrous , stony fruits , called nuts , provide highly concentrated foods , oils , and other materials of value .	53.473724
most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick , adherent , brown covering -- the seedcoat .	32.0407
the kernels of brazil nuts , cashews , coconuts , filberts , hazelnuts , hickory nuts , pecans , walnuts , and pine nuts are predominantly oily .	5.400937
almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein .	46.24758
the world production of familiar seed nuts -- almonds , brazil nuts , filberts , and the english walnuts -- totals about 300 thousand tons annually .	17.982834
coconuts , the fruit of the coconut palm , have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in south pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets .	61.068764
the oil palm of west africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit .	19.424017
world production of copra , the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut , was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959 .	21.306616
exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons , about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil .	66.81784
other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg	1.7286193
the soap nut , which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins	88.24267
the marking nut , used for ink and varnish	6.9706187
and the sweet-smelling cumara nut , which is suited for perfumes .	13.136914
a forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm .	32.147236
the so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed .	4.5948553
it is used for making buttons and other small , hard objects of turnery .	90.34347
seeds of the sago palm are used in bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists .	48.28257
the color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations .	38.548557
since biblical times , rosaries have been made from jobs-tears -- the seeds of an asiatic grass .	28.254717
bead tree seeds are the necklaces of south pacific islanders and the eyes of buddha dolls in cuba .	33.288773
victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry .	31.60713
handmade christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year .	13.413079
tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components .	14.276729
although science has given us more effective materials , preparations from anise , castorbean , colchicum , nux vomica , mustard , fennel , and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments .	10.518725
flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons .	81.014725
peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection .	53.90205
still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny , dry , seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods , although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible .	51.373363
the common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group .	150.53381
each year millions of pounds of anise , caraway , mustard , celery , and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported .	10.81934
single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family , such as cumin , dill , fennel , and angelica .	6.5208344
less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom .	12.843289
white pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit .	120.082085
sesame seed , which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in egypt , brazil , and central america , has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds .	31.298332
it is a main flavoring for halvah , the candy of the middle east .	26.88869
sesame sticks , a snack dip , originated in the southwest .	12.459693
beverages are made from seeds the world over .	22.047743
coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree .	5.2341137
world production of coffee broke all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons .	28.266338
per capita consumption remains around 16 pounds in the united states .	6.5295715
cocoa , chocolate , and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree .	10.332322
world production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between africa ( 63 percent ) and south america ( 27 percent ) .	17.246016
several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts , the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the west indies and south america .	8.971252
cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages .	4.0416207
the japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain .	5.177503
arrack is distilled from fermented rice in india .	3.141787
beer , generally fermented from barley , is an old alcoholic beverage .	16.481031
beer was brewed by the babylonians and egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago .	40.741627
brewers today use corn , rice , and malted barley .	2.5814922
distillers use corn , malt , wheat , grain sorghum , and rye in making beverage alcohol .	19.05763
seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the united states .	15.3354
the farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes , including the cereals , is nearly 10 billion dollars a year .	28.612236
cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised .	94.87754
the economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater , because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn , oats , barley , and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed , cottonseed , and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry , meat , and dairy products .	18.89889
seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock .	9.339333
hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed .	21.22866
seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain , baking , crushing oilseed , refining edible oil , brewing , distilling , and mixing feed .	6.542199
more than 11 thousand business establishments in the united states were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954 .	8.9971
the value of products from these industries was 15 . 8 billion dollars , of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes .	64.19445
not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products .	25.161602
cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the american diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry .	16.099548
to hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called `` locatin ' ' ' ' em .	39.086967
to keep ' em scattered somewhat and yet herd ' em was called `` loose herdin ' ' ' .	16.198599
to hold ' em in a compact mass was `` close herdin ' ' ' .	16.600645
cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted .	31.708233
that became their `` home range ' ' .	4.9990034
yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin ' grass and water .	24.20073
these became `` strays ' ' , the term bein ' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as `` stray hosses ' ' , not merely `` strays ' ' .	23.618042
cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over .	36.373123
you had to go with ' em or wait till the storm was over , and follow .	78.30869
such marchin ' in wholesale numbers was called a `` drift ' ' , or `` winter drift ' ' , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range .	17.888535
the cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals .	19.378279
the single animal or a small bunch were referred to as `` strays ' '	21.774961
but when a large number were `` bunched up ' ' or `` banded up ' ' , and marched away from their home range , as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a `` drift ' ' .	21.722055
drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds , but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought , or as an aftermath of a stampede .	36.686424
drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had ' nough sense to avoid ' em , and to find shelter for ' emselves .	66.44569
the wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards , and sometimes droughts , over a wide range of territory was called a `` die-up ' ' .	14.792398
followin ' such an event there was usually a harvest of `` fallen hides ' ' , and the ranchers needed skinnin ' knives instead of brandin ' irons .	12.08556
cattle were said to be `` potted ' ' when `` blizzard choked ' ' , that is , caught in a corner or a draw , or against a `` drift fence ' ' durin ' a storm .	24.855885
cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the `` winter kill ' ' .	11.356843
when cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to `` bow up ' ' .	22.082458
this term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin ' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , `` he arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm ' ' .	27.63841
cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature ' em into prime beef were said to be `` double wintered ' ' .	39.01639
cattle brought into a range from a distance were called `` immigrants ' ' .	49.922157
them new to the country were referred to as `` pilgrims ' ' .	14.326378
this word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle , but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot .	61.10943
hereford cattle were often called `` white faces ' ' , or `` open-face cattle ' ' , and the old-time cowman gave the name of `` hothouse stock ' ' to them newly introduced cattle .	14.27937
because holstein cattle weren ' t a beef breed , they were rarely seen on a ranch , though one might be found now and then for the milk supply .	50.710255
the cowboy called this breed of cattle `` magpies ' ' .	2.1951144
a `` cattaloe ' ' was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle .	12.595568
`` dry stock ' ' denoted , regardless of age or sex , such bovines as were givin ' no milk .	33.821636
a `` wet herd ' ' was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows , while `` wet stuff ' ' referred to cows givin ' milk .	24.213108
the cowboy ' s humorous name for a cow givin ' milk was a `` milk pitcher ' ' .	3.9875188
cows givin ' no milk were knowed as `` strippers ' ' .	2.5790763
the terminology of the range , in speakin ' of `` dry stock ' ' and `` wet stock ' ' , was confusin ' to the tenderfoot .	16.489069
the most common reference to `` wet stock ' ' was with the meanin ' that such animals had been smuggled across the rio grande after bein ' stolen from their rightful owners .	22.068321
the term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals .	152.90103
`` mixed herd ' ' meant a herd of mixed sexes , while a `` straight steer herd ' ' was one composed entirely of steers , and when the cowman spoke of `` mixed cattle ' ' , he meant cattle of various grades , ages , and sexes .	22.745678
in the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass , this was spoken of as `` turn-out time ' ' , or `` put to grass ' ' .	36.163338
`` shootin ' ' em out ' ' was gettin ' cattle out of a corral onto the range .	30.075249
when a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin ' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin ' ' ' .	29.08296
to stir cattle up and get ' em heated and excited was to `` mustard the cattle ' ' , and the act was called `` ginnin ' ' em ' round ' ' , or `` chousin ' ' em ' ' .	13.956986
after a roundup the pushin ' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called `` throwin ' over ' ' .	56.771954
a cow rose from the ground rear end first .	239.84497
by the time her hindquarters were in a standin ' position , her knees were on the ground in a prayin ' attitude .	24.029293
it was when she was in this position that the name `` prayin ' cow ' ' was suggested to the cowboy .	17.87263
they were said to be `` on their heads ' ' when grazin ' .	28.066944
`` on the hoof ' ' was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin ' to cattle travelin ' by trail under their own power as against goin ' by rail .	56.837856
shippin ' cattle by train was called a `` stock run ' ' .	6.6138887
a general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers ' ' .	1.8782943
when a cowboy spoke of `` dustin ' ' ' a cow , he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes .	28.574522
the cow , unlike a bull or steer , kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin ' , and a cow `` on the prod ' ' or `` on the peck ' ' was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges .	37.239887
the injun ' s name for beef was `` wohaw ' ' , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the injun on the trails .	15.966466
the first cattle the injuns saw under the white man ' s control were the ox teams of the early freighters .	42.673836
listenin ' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted `` whoa ' ' , `` haw ' ' , and `` gee ' ' , they thought them words the names of the animals , and began callin ' cattle `` wohaws ' ' .	12.436878
rarely did a trail herd pass through the injun country on its march north that it wasn ' t stopped to receive demand for `` wohaw ' ' .	34.33832
`` tailin ' ' ' was the throwin ' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope .	23.324497
any animal could when travelin ' fast , be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin ' the brute , seizin ' its tail , and givin ' the latter a pull to one side .	35.114265
this throwed the animal off balance , and over it ' d crash onto its head and shoulders .	50.484356
though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin ' results , many men assured success through a turn of the tail ' bout the saddle horn , supplemented sometimes , in the case of cattle , by a downward heave of the rider ' s leg upon the strainin ' tail .	29.96421
such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns , and a thorough `` tailin ' ' ' usually knocked the breath out of a steer , and so dazed ' im that he ' d behave for the rest of the day .	21.150915
it required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin ' rider .	18.538483
when cattle became more valuable , ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued , at least when the boss was ' round .	67.75893
when the cowboy used the word `` tailin ' s ' ' , he meant stragglers .	13.952195
`` bull tailin ' ' ' was a game once pop ' lar with the mexican cowboys of texas .	24.788162
from a pen of wild bulls one would be released , and with much yellin ' a cowhand ' d take after ' im .	27.062704
seizin ' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin ' the bull off balance , and `` bustin ' ' ' ' im with terrific force .	30.079147
rammin ' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold ' im down was called `` peggin ' ' ' .	31.803802
colors of cattle came in for their special names .	28.853184
an animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a `` brindle ' ' or `` brockle ' ' .	9.462035
a `` lineback ' ' was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin ' down its back , while a `` lobo stripe ' ' was the white , yeller , or brown stripe runnin ' down the back , from neck to tail , a characteristic of many spanish cattle .	38.04451
a `` mealynose ' ' was a cow or steer of the longhorn type , with lines and dots of a color lighter ' n the rest of its body ' round the eyes , face , and nose .	77.68377
such an animal was said to be `` mealynosed ' ' .	2.0471349
`` sabinas ' ' was a spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin ' .	17.615831
the northern cowboy called all the red mexican cattle which went up the trail `` sonora reds ' ' , while they called all cattle drove up from mexico `` yaks ' ' , because they came from the yaqui injun country , or gave ' em the name of `` mexican buckskins ' ' .	28.211132
near the southern border , cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback , with white speckles frequently appearin ' on the sides and belly , were called `` zorrillas ' ' .	26.853533
this word was from the spanish , meanin ' `` polecat ' ' .	8.925344
`` yeller bellies ' ' were cattle of mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color .	20.051832
an animal with distinct coloration , or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders , was sometimes used as a `` marker ' ' .	54.281708
such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler .	8.275532
countin ' each grazin ' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin ' it back so that it didn ' t mix with the uncounted cattle was called a `` range count ' ' .	26.00282
the countin ' of cattle in a pasture without throwin ' ' em together for the purpose was called a `` pasture count ' ' .	22.099972
the counters rode through the pasture countin ' each bunch of grazin ' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn ' t get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead .	28.294558
this method of countin ' was usually done at the request , and in the presence , of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd .	58.62321
them notes and mortgages were spoken of as `` cattle paper ' ' .	36.278572
a `` book count ' ' was the sellin ' of cattle by the books , commonly resorted to in the early days , sometimes much to the profit of the seller .	29.790344
this led to the famous sayin ' in the northwest of the `` books won ' t freeze ' ' .	9.27902
this became a common byword durin ' the boom days when eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests .	92.93554
the origin of this sayin ' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of luke murrin .	8.605314
his saloon was a meetin ' place for influential wyoming cattlemen , and one year durin ' a severe blizzard , when his herd-owner customers were wearin ' long faces , he said , `` cheer up , boys , whatever happens , the books won ' t freeze ' ' .	34.157265
in this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin ' custom of buyin ' by book count , and created a sayin ' which has survived through the years .	52.03336
`` range delivery ' ' meant that the buyer , after examinin ' the seller ' s ranch records and considerin ' his rep ' tation for truthfulness , paid for what the seller claimed to own , then rode out and tried to find it .	48.008324
when a cowhand said that a man had `` good cow sense ' ' , he meant to pay ' im a high compliment .	35.657063
no matter by what name cattle were called , there was no denyin ' that they not only saved texas from financial ruin , but went far toward redeemin ' from a wilderness vast territories of the northwest .	60.889996
the first use of the word `` rustler ' ' was as a synonym for `` hustler ' ' , becomin ' an established term for any person who was active , pushin ' , and bustlin ' in any enterprise .	30.52668
again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler , and when the order was given to go out and `` rustle the hosses ' ' , it meant for ' im to go out and herd ' em in .	22.163795
eventually herdin ' the hosses was spoken of as `` hoss rustlin ' ' ' , and the wrangler was called the `` hoss rustler ' ' .	7.241927
later , the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief , startin ' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to `` get out and rustle a few mavericks ' ' .	17.958755
it was john who found the lion tracks .	20.709515
he found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and jones knew it was a hot trail .	54.02683
he stifled the comanche yell and let john lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain .	29.593893
this mountain was known as the black reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass .	24.391172
on the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly .	60.413986
kearton and ulyate had started the day together while jones followed the dogs , and means and loveless had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , ulyate reined in , in the shadow of the reef and pointed .	53.50276
`` that ' s the colonel ' ' , he said , `` but i can ' t see the dogs ' ' .	7.949059
as they watched , jones rode straight for the reef .	4.0245957
then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him .	35.115974
the dogs were working a trail -- lion ? ?	34.83146
the pack had made a bend to the north , swinging back toward the reef , and kearton and ulyate could hear them faintly .	13.2104435
kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring loveless and means and the rest of the party .	46.25592
`` not yet ' ' , cautioned ulyate .	4.1950974
jones came toward them fast , now , along the southern toe of the reef , and the dogs could be heard plainly , old john with his grand canyon voice outstanding above the others .	66.96523
there was sounder , too , also a veteran of the north rim , and rastus and the rake from a pack of english fox-hounds , and a collie from a london pound , and simba , a terrier .	24.776577
a motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty .	265.32944
jones was galloping close behind them leaning down , cheering them on .	56.82642
ulyate said , and kearton touched a match to the pile of grass , blew on it and flame licked out .	9.929014
he threw green stuff on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose .	30.143496
`` that will fetch the gang and tell the colonel where we are ' ' .	64.964775
then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying .	3.8422527
kearton and ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound .	68.26917
it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away .	153.0767
at the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot .	42.471962
the route was choked with rugged lava-rocks , creepers and bushes , so thickly overgrown that when kearton lost sight of ulyate and called , ulyate answered from ten feet away .	37.869026
nice country to meet a lion in face to face .	13.745973
ulyate and kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion , till they came , out of breath , to the crest , and peering through the branches of a bush , this is what ulyate saw jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside , sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness , who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him , while the dogs whirled around her .	34.622234
ulyate drew back with a start , and put finger to lips , almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off , `` the dogs have got her bayed .	63.023304
she ' s just the other side of that bush ' ' ! !	29.17514
and when they had drawn back a step he added `` jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her .	62.561783
why she doesn ' t charge him , i don ' t know .	7.185903
and he hasn ' t even got a knife on him .	17.099974
he couldn ' t get away from her in this kind of ground .	127.04532
careful , don ' t disturb her ' ' .	1.3127288
jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the reef .	41.007076
she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared , opening her mouth wide , lashing her tail , and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation , as much as to say `` how dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct ' ' ? ?	42.001987
intuition told him , however , that she was tired and winded from the run up the reef and would not charge , yet .	77.22683
he moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her , being careful , because he knew the female is less predictable than the male .	42.71919
( in the graveyard at nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso .	25.545006
of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses .	27.267843
) she snarled terribly but intuition told him , again , that she was bluffing , and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs .	26.03301
it was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock .	37.977547
even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her .	72.80475
but john nipped her rear end -- one lion ' s rear end was as good as another to john , africa , arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at john , but he ducked back .	70.58606
jones then recoiled his rope and threw again , this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her .	53.540195
she whirled and faced him , roaring terribly , and ulyate , watching through the leaves , could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him , because he wouldn ' t have much of a chance of getting away , in that thick growth , but she seemed just a trace uncertain	56.348797
while jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer .	209.18394
from the lioness ' point of view , this strange creature on the back of another creature , lashing out with its long thin paw , very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with .	59.63775
but now she sank lower to the rock .	6.693948
although she appeared more subdued and defeated , jones knew she was growing more dangerous .	134.42036
she was rested and could mount a charge .	18.254295
just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched , and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet .	15.474544
at this moment , loveless and means arrived , crashing through the undergrowth with their horses , and distracted her , and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks .	30.062588
the dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded old john .	66.19485
`` we ' ve got to get her out of there ' ' ! !	37.2847
jones yelled , `` or she ' ll kill ' em all .	20.730808
for such an emergency he had included fourth-of-july cannon crackers as part of their equipment .	24.84949
lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed .	21.562836
`` ain ' t she a beauty , though ' ' ? ?	18.84547
`` don ' t you go a step nearer her than i do ' ' , jones warned , `` and if you do , go at a run so you ' ll have momentum ' ' ! !	37.79039
for two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the reef , trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw .	57.81091
but she clung to the rocks and brush , and the day wore away .	27.364943
it was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again .	76.62226
and the sun was beginning to go down .	6.252625
`` i ' ll get a pole ' ' , jones said finally , `` and i ' ll poke a noose over her head ' ' ! !	19.896173
at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the reef .	7.8144083
ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions ' heads with poles , and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago , not the gentler ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason .	39.86994
`` it won ' t work , colonel ' ' .	10.58967
`` just the same we ' ll try it ' ' .	2.8866785
but without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain .	44.93562
john led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood .	60.912907
john himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail , but he was in this fight to the finish , running almost as strongly now as in the morning .	98.42533
she took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully , crouched at the base of a thorn tree , and waited for them to come up .	15.546601
with the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land .	34.38002
`` careful , now ' ' , jones warned .	14.099309
very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding , edging closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to spin and run , rope whining about his head , horse edging tensely under him , but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion .	24.120047
they tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion , but these didn ' t .	39.05862
again she snarled , and again he edged .	18.840899
with a whirling jump , it could get into gear .	30.146852
however nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance , unless it was a cheetah .	19.672188
she was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here jones and loveless and ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound .	59.096386
means held steady one jump ahead of her .	43.250954
a western cowpony had outrun an african lion , from a standing start .	47.881107
photos showed later that she ' d been about six feet from means .	124.19894
of course the factor of head start made all the difference .	61.541832
the lioness quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn ' t catch means , and made for jones .	56.664963
as she had done with means , she gained rapidly at first , but then baldy began to draw away .	47.177685
somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point .	95.04109
when jones too drew away , she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully , crouched low and waited as before .	24.512014
this new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance .	123.49148
there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went .	132.44658
so means edged around on the north side of her , jones moved in from the south .	91.47696
tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention .	21.184069
he succeeded almost too well , because once she rose as if to charge , and he half wheeled his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she sank back .	84.342514
from behind her means shot forward at a run .	92.99756
kearton began shouting , `` wait , wait -- the camera ' s jammed ' ' ! !	10.797902
he raced by within twenty feet of her , roped her around the neck , but a lioness ' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off .	36.614655
the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies .	82.47268
but the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life .	48.980007
the christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty .	79.91518
the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives .	33.93968
most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .	33.78055
they may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical rover boys ' ' , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so .	74.20378
as long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt .	10.019044
the next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community .	77.181404
progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference ' ' of the national council or the world council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors .	58.91156
the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .	82.50249
until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality .	51.158424
as things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any main street in the nation .	34.136726
the crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community .	27.749542
the decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members .	38.283867
it is here that the local and ecumenical must meet .	130.51517
it is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .	90.83586
it has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots ' ' .	25.631641
this way of describing the matter is unfortunate .	3.5743139
one is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top ' ' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels ' ' .	56.145817
the truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god throughout the world .	43.23252
the other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations .	33.596783
however needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ in the world .	31.144567
the basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation .	56.185425
it is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .	22.969055
most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .	103.86046
the idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .	72.77425
the jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the christian congregation , but hinduism , buddhism , islam , confucianism , taoism , shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love .	24.233784
their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship .	67.0792
how far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the new testament means by koinonia ! !	131.73598
what is now called christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes .	48.31939
the koinonia of acts and of the epistles means sharing in a common relation to christ .	70.51477
it is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of christ in his people .	30.154257
as dietrich bonhoffer puts it , `` our community with one another consists solely in what christ has done to both of us ' ' .	70.69212
this may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all .	49.52998
there is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building .	47.241047
whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal church , in vital relation with the whole body of christ and participating in his mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid .	30.883505
the antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .	145.74635
of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the people of god will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place .	39.186356
each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .	32.107605
our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other .	65.08741
and this is what all too often happens .	3.7455413
a little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor bela vasady at the end of the second world war .	33.323982
with great difficulty he made his way from his native hungary to geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the provisional committee for the world council of churches .	21.467232
when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones .	64.082085
he often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical ' ' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church .	29.783478
it is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right relation to both .	101.38872
as things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other .	25.2748
on the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town .	54.288532
they do not escape the pitfall into which charles dickens pictured mrs . jellyby as falling .	26.256454
her concern for the natives of borrioboola-gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son peepy ! !	72.310585
likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in east germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary china , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in south africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals .	26.72662
on the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission .	71.04845
as a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families .	36.527367
it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members .	53.821896
the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world .	33.950466
the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs .	55.946716
it is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .	23.918001
its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .	98.134315
it provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .	20.25316
it helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible .	9.0156765
it draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation .	37.698715
and it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .	82.304214
but what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians in the world ? ?	75.809616
all too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind .	49.916267
it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of christ .	35.69476
it is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .	46.320946
it is not making them sensitive to the sub-christian level of much of our economic and industrial life .	90.442474
it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples .	18.795403
it is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in asia and africa .	38.370056
to put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want .	70.973335
it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility in relation to the world .	39.00343
we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness and mission to the world .	63.495106
there is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community .	52.053955
he built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn .	55.668285
desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it .	42.533813
a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , `` do you belong to this church , mr . rancher ' ' ? ?	24.604181
`` why , no , ma ' am ' ' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me ' ' ! !	10.574611
the story reflects the way too many people feel .	85.91543
as long as the congregation regards the church as `` our ' ' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my ' ' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance .	60.03635
there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to christ , and that it is his purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do .	47.88065
a local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church .	74.65587
it would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the church of christ .	52.961243
yet the truth , according to the new testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place .	50.34608
yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms	59.88958
and buggies and wagons and chugging fords kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap .	93.989525
this was a bitterly fought game , carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight , with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd .	53.895023
every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink , they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision .	66.75695
at one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys , he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was `` dead ' ' or the base runners were free to score .	42.823895
this was typical of such games , which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship .	85.57554
when the visitors , after losing this game , rode along the village streets toward home , the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly , `` you bunch of hay-shakers ! !	29.545528
baseball was surely the national game in those days , even though professional baseball may have been merely a business .	100.67288
radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a pasture , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the cubs or the pirates or the indians or the red sox .	51.12318
young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places , even if they failed to make the major leagues .	48.407944
nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the three i league , or the pony league , or the coastal plains league , or the fast eastern league , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere .	51.904476
even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over .	65.19321
babe ruth , of course , was everyone ' s hero , and everyone knew him , even though relatively few ever saw him play ball .	93.0926
his face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life .	123.0802
as the twenties grew older , and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals , the great hitters ( always led by babe ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account .	49.134
boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up ' ' on a bat as willie keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done .	31.1997
other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching ruth , who was still called jidge by all his friends , or leo or two-head by those who dared to taunt him ( leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` kid ' ' .	38.903675
lou gehrig was given the nickname buster , and he ran ruth a close race in home runs .	47.346195
but the nickname never stuck and gehrig was no match for ruth in `` color ' ' -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field .	78.93401
ruth was a delinquent boy still , but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it .	37.185234
a few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with daddy browning ' s , al capone ' s , earl sande ' s , and the prince of wales ' .	19.600447
one who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was charles arthur shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , art the great , or the great shires .	56.143196
it was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists .	65.83627
he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond	39.444263
and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in art ' s pocket once when he had occasion to collar the great first baseman for some forgotten reason .	60.65625
( this made a sportswriter named pegler wonder in print if art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager .	90.22375
) the sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public .	65.12383
in his minor way charles arthur shires was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these scott fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers .	65.19837
there were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down	31.099573
or who ingested strange objects , like live fish	13.39974
or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner	206.84283
or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath .	21.151672
one young man , exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the yale bowl during the yale-army football game , landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below , and died at once .	33.941685
but the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition .	92.39214
the business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments , and performers -- thanks partly to george herman ruth ' s spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too .	83.7317
while fifty years before , albert goodwill spalding , secretary of the chicago ball club of the national league , could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in august , in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate .	31.750246
and while less than ten years earlier the wayward black sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy charles comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season .	48.664886
the greatest team of this period was unquestionably the new york yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named ed barrow and miller huggins .	49.685272
boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the red sox -- sold to millionaires huston and ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire .	30.621683
ruth himself , still owning his farm in massachusetts and an interest in the massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from fenway park , followed by pitchers carl mays , leslie `` joe ' ' bush , waite hoyt , herb pennock , and sam jones , catcher wally schang , third baseman joe dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio ' ' of ruth , dugan , and hoyt ) , and shortstop everett scott .	20.63878
by 1926 , when the mighty yanks were at their mightiest , only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest , even beside able and agile rookies like tony lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ) , mark koenig , lou gehrig , george pipgras , and gray-thatched earl combs .	22.30003
the deeds of this team , through two seasons and in the two world ' s series that followed , have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said .	78.19373
but there is one small episode that a few new york fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one world ' s series game in 1926 like best to recall .	51.15461
babe ruth , as he always did in the stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and tommy thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the st . louis cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where ruth could not reach it .	57.99908
the ball lay there , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` where ' s the -- -ing ball ' ' ? ?	43.54474
but , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me ' ' , so little tommy ran all the way home .	55.48429
the ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those golden days , or of any other sporting event for that matter .	135.09654
promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .	50.413414
radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers ' ' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .	71.444084
in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring .	63.84729
this had a pleasant effect upon the sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .	48.433643
while women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a `` dead game sport ' ' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one .	47.766605
the questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers	65.031815
for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball , just as every male american in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists .	61.177532
and women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball .	27.760752
radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` ladies ' days ' ' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home .	92.6619
women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears .	70.89656
the radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school .	85.57337
this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal ' ' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .	74.349
our discussion of this involves using erik erikson ' s schema of `` identity vs . identity diffusion ' ' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier .	23.21709
our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers .	33.51843
we hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence .	19.188766
hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual ' s infancy and end in his old age , erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises .	28.342136
the successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual ' s positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence .	47.894245
within erikson ' s schema , the adolescent ' s delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion ' ' , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively .	31.124704
the adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs . time diffusion .	134.65875
time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives .	62.193256
erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .	103.23739
experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately .	36.68577
these polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters .	38.3161
some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences .	47.350372
others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .	51.483974
for many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general .	68.91037
however , as erickson has noted , the individual ' s failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence .	56.65656
and , as shown in chapter 6 , , some snp females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents .	142.23422
in the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust .	55.40992
the adolescent experiences two closely related crises self-certainty vs . an identity consciousness	97.43653
a sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one ' s own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy .	62.31972
however , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups	88.33904
inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards	1816.4443
and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded .	143.49915
her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends .	60.99266
to be different is to invite shame and doubt	2772.83
and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one ' s parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one ' s peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status .	64.15516
the attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty .	95.995285
many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others	103.57253
but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one ' s self .	84.30262
another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs . work-paralysis .	13.326863
the adolescent ' s capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood .	34.68132
the developmental process involves the individual ' s progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one ' s own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be ' ' ) .	92.69627
these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .	51.70902
if she has not had such experiences , the female ' s normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded .	39.80503
she may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e . g . , whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker	69.10339
whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school	383.25055
whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school	106.116135
and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .	180.39578
erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship ' ' .	12.691273
this paralysis may be expressed in the female ' s starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study	102.44992
and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes .	54.858906
the absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting .	59.821396
the comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship .	13.033964
they attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made	68.158485
they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably .	103.589615
these things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty .	45.037422
as their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs .	19.075195
these affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done .	104.35788
childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy .	19.933088
the excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience .	95.3514
for example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence	51.81839
they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting .	56.018284
on the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior .	90.18292
the adolescent also faces the identity crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs . diffusion of ideals .	16.242344
in discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose erikson ' s concept on our data .	18.39325
adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as `` either-or ' ' , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant .	24.364534
this tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents .	47.007618
erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man ' s-land between childhood and adulthood .	36.407127
it provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion .	81.242424
the positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty .	74.17068
most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .	20.394222
the diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .	46.176647
a pronounced ideological diffusion -- i . e . , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways .	34.8173
for example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice .	109.73638
it is mirrored by the individual willie lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment .	64.88853
in another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers ' ' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs .	30.49398
the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother ' s inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior .	74.6022
for example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly ' ' .	87.797226
they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse .	23.044836
they condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating .	11.422021
they criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong	42.852352
and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive ' ' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant ' ' .	45.771824
in the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent ' s search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .	84.56053
for example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys ' ' and the `` bad guys ' ' , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences .	27.282352
in the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides .	52.540867
an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive .	37.18894
yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation , which many regarded as wasteful , indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure .	36.290043
the duration and other circumstances of the selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions .	23.311205
the suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent attorneys , inventors , and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the american patent system .	61.65562
chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity .	36.15495
in a long and angry footnote to his opinion , judge hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism .	22.828344
`` it is a duty ' ' , said hough , `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the supreme court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation .	52.137123
as long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition , rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer , i fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged , and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of equity ' ' .	24.88587
observing that `` reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples ' ' , hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures .	26.380623
he cited the elephantine dimensions of the selden case record	147.4586
the `` objections stated at outrageous length ' '	1.0071038
and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts , `` uncalled for and unjustifiable , from the retort discourteous to the lie direct ' ' .	28.368889
the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was `` a striking ( though not singular ) example ' ' , concluded hough , `` will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or exclusion of testimony ' ' .	60.22223
not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the selden suit .	37.853394
william a . redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years .	80.46932
inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform , inevitably centering upon the selden litigation as a `` horrible example ' ' .	22.986137
its costive deliberations were likened to those of the british courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by dickens in bleak house .	47.948666
parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects .	11.926651
but he felt that the selden case was being unfairly pilloried .	9.112248
in a detailed letter published in the scientific american in 1912 , he remarked that `` loose statements ' ' about the case showed scant understanding of the facts .	36.289635
the suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases .	106.78285
parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony .	23.662151
in a private communication written in 1911 , parker had been more to the point .	142.7155
noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded ' ' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent .	44.065514
the vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance ' ' for or against the patent , said parker .	64.32146
`` this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur ' ' .	47.757862
parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony .	147.15166
the most important of these found him in agreement with hough ' s plea for reform .	37.437542
parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony .	98.38892
the taking of depositions , he suggested , should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony .	41.41032
`` i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued , it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that ' ' .	73.581436
in the end hough ' s acidulous protest , which parker called the `` now somewhat famous note on this ' selden ' case ' ' , did not go unheeded .	102.65677
in 1912 the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on february 1 , 1913 .	53.375134
the revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform .	10.4644785
under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character .	79.122475
other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits .	8.560525
one of the a . l . a . m . lawyers observed that if the selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , `` at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume ' ' .	54.327972
while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money .	44.61013
there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the supreme court as a direct result of the selden patent suit .	9.813008
even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 , the a . l . a . m . was succeeded by the automobile board of trade , the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day automobile manufacturers association .	25.165995
the trade bodies which came in the wake of the a . l . a . m . were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion .	35.62783
nevertheless , it is from the selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade .	25.891378
one of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of american industrial cooperation .	32.541676
its origin lies in the selden patent controversy and its aftermath .	20.372314
from the earliest days of the motor car industry , before the a . l . a . m . was established , patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem .	24.005081
many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns .	12.557118
the fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims .	41.046604
as early as 1900 a wall street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers .	55.248745
this scheme failed , and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 .	30.545061
in this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the a . l . a . m . at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation .	28.30747
the interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the a . l . a . m . patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology .	57.87159
one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among a . l . a . m . members .	21.621038
within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement .	57.906178
its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly .	19.946724
since the a . l . a . m . holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents , the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry .	29.868626
the highly important dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the a . l . a . m . pool .	22.927595
but henry ford used the planetary transmission in his model t and earlier cars and , in 1905 , as a precautionary measure , took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor .	77.08629
for those affiliated with it , the a . l . a . m . pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 .	45.18773
by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases , many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions .	16.119293
it was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail .	40.868587
`` purely from the business man ' s standpoint and without regard to the lawyer ' s view ' ' , commented a trade journal , `` the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business , instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation ' ' .	70.92033
occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications .	49.397892
one manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said `` i would readily put over $50 , 000 into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits ' ' .	41.056488
the prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee `` the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions , including delays surrounding legal disputes , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste ' ' .	48.554035
by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information .	60.87786
at this point charles c . hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the national automobile chamber of commerce , successor to the automobile board of trade .	33.51685
hanch was treasurer of the nordyke & marmon company , an indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the marmon car in 1904 .	22.053415
he had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890 ' s .	18.750063
anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , hanch went to detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading a . l . a . m . members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan .	30.99597
the breach created by the selden patent doomed his proposal , but hanch did not abandon his scheme .	28.48278
after the demise of the a . l . a . m . , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool .	14.490335
most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents .	61.0816
`` it is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned ' ' , said a trade authority , `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day ' ' .	66.572105
with the other members of the patents committee -- wilfred c . leland , howard e . coffin , windsor t . white , and w . h . vandervoort -- hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution .	33.25089
the plan was supported by frederick p . fish , counsel for the national automobile chamber of commerce .	25.443184
it will be recalled that in his summation for the a . l . a . m . before judge hough , fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial community .	34.674873
he was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value .	59.945663
`` my personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making ' ' , he later told a congressional committee .	150.67157
the eloquent persuasions of fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association .	22.591948
drawn up in 1914 , the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915 .	48.44489
it remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925 .	21.230213
a little farther along the road you come to the church of santa sabina , called the `` pearl of the aventine ' ' .	15.885975
continue another hundred yards to the piazza of the knights of malta .	11.282756
on the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments .	27.248055
the massive gate of the maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in rome .	39.007996
if you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of st . peter ' s framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees .	21.614159
retrace your steps a few yards on the via di santa sabina and turn right on the via di s . alessio , a street lined with stately homes .	17.06269
oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section .	164.61417
turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the via di santa prisca to the viale aventino .	18.02414
here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city .	30.529648
these two walks take you through the heart of rome .	8.142208
you will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi .	56.738503
you will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the spanish steps , and the lovely pincian gardens .	27.710033
by seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of renaissance rome .	80.986374
you will realize why rome is indeed the eternal city .	181.42389
start on the via d . teatro di marcello at the foot of the capitoline hill .	6.449611
the majestic circular tiers of stone of the theatre of marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the emperor augustus erected in 13 b . c . .	28.10086
twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in roman days .	147.35983
andrea palladio , an italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its doric and ionic columns .	7.5670567
wander past the three superb columns of apollo by the arches of the theatre .	19.877937
the remains of the portico of octavia are now in front of you .	30.771149
climb the steps from the theatre to the via della tribuna di campitelli for an even better view of the columns of apollo .	40.393505
turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny piazza campitelli , then proceed along the via dei funari to the piazza mattei .	16.30824
here is one of the loveliest fountains in rome , the fontana delle tartarughe or `` fountain of the tortoises ' ' .	5.261183
it ' s typical of rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square .	45.69757
stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths , each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin .	26.639793
the figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement .	75.40324
opposite is the palazzo mattei , one of rome ' s oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the italo-american association .	15.797214
go inside for a closer look at a renaissance palace .	36.55398
in the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes , and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall .	22.673552
the palazzo caetani , still inhabited by the caetani family , adjoins the palazzo mattei .	6.385325
keep straight ahead on the via falegnami , cross the wide via arenula , and you will come to the piazza b . cairoli , where you should look in at the church of san carlo ai catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling .	20.923239
follow the colorful and busy via d . giubbonari for a hundred yards or so .	43.866695
now turn left at the via dell ' arco del monte to the piazza dei pellegrini .	4.5721865
just a few yards to the right on the via capo di ferro will bring you to the palazzo spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the council of state .	14.981869
paintings by titian , caravaggio , and rubens are on display ( open 9 30 to 4 00 ) .	60.58063
before you enter the palazzo , note francesco borromini ' s facade .	4.179795
the great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts .	18.80774
the large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of pompey at the base of which julius caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) .	31.192453
( this is shown in the afternoon and on sunday morning .	88.78261
by tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard borromini ' s unusual and fascinating trick in perspective .	24.173845
when you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance , yet it is actually only a few feet away .	28.74621
the sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front .	45.601715
the gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive .	17.367277
from the palazzo spada you continue another block along the via capo di ferro and vicolo de venti to the imposing palazzo farnese , begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all .	18.850687
michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it .	186.12447
today it is occupied by the french embassy .	4.902542
its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen sundays ( 11 00 to 12 00 noon ) .	38.82561
ask to see the modern tapestries of paris and rome designed by lurcat .	41.372425
directly in front of the palace along the via d . baullari you will come to the campo di fiori , the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of renaissance rome .	17.108595
today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market .	28.440693
continue on the via d . baullari to the corso vittorio emanuele , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the church of sant ' andrea della valle .	19.00149
as you approach the church on the via d . baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the roman theatre of pompey , near which is believed to have been the place where julius caesar was assassinated .	40.274597
the dome of the church is , outside of st . peter ' s , one of the largest in rome .	16.843515
opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of tosca .	32.114227
at this point you cross the wide corso vittorio emanuele 2 , , walk along the corso del rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the via dei canestrani to enter the splendid piazza navona , one of the truly glorious sights in rome .	15.831284
your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk .	68.10559
the site of the oblong piazza is domitian ' s ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races .	46.205128
for centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events .	10.422357
from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages .	37.096497
giovanni bernini ' s `` fountain of the rivers ' ' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a roman obelisk from the circus of maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the danube , the ganges , the nile , and the plate .	25.179434
the eyes of the figure of the nile are covered , perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the church of sant ' agnese in agone , the work of bernini ' s rival , borromini .	29.370739
in the piazza navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square .	26.558784
the scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about rome .	130.6822
perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch .	140.06656
take the via di s . agnese in agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful church of santa maria della pace .	61.139095
inside you will find the lovely sibyls painted by raphael and a chapel designed by michelangelo .	13.420573
the church ' s cloisters are among donato bramante ' s most beautiful creations .	4.481214
now return to the piazza navona and leave it on the opposite side by the corsia agonale	10.517867
in a moment cross the corso del rinascimento .	6.6639333
in front of you is the palazzo madama , once belonging to the medici and now the italian senate .	34.83276
walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the via giustiniani you will come to the piazza della rotonda .	14.471527
you are now facing the pantheon , the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient rome .	58.906532
this circular edifice , constructed by agrippa in b . c . 27 , was rebuilt in its present shape by the emperor hadrian .	13.723937
it was dedicated as a church in the seventh century .	2.4251406
as you pause in the piazza by the egyptian obelisk brought from the temple of isis , you will admire the pantheon ' s impressive corinthian columns .	7.485744
the pantheon ' s interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph .	28.634441
its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling .	17.035904
the only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome .	14.107349
standing before the tomb of raphael , the great genius of the renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of rome .	53.15204
as you leave the pantheon , take the narrow street to the right , the via del seminario , a block to sant ' ignazio , one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city .	12.700596
( along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , la sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in rome .	30.590117
) the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set .	79.70954
this is one of the most charming little squares in this part of rome .	19.174479
one block along the via de burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the stock exchange in the old temple of neptune .	31.204147
a few yards farther , on the via dei bergamaschi , is the piazza colonna .	4.174867
the great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the emperor marcus aurelius .	11.303659
you are now at the corso , though narrow , one of rome ' s busiest streets .	25.587326
horse races took place here in the middle ages .	7.817226
if you have taken this stroll in the morning , and you have the time and inclination , walk to the right along the crowded corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the palazzo doria ( open sunday , tuesday , and thursday , 10 00 to 1 00 ) .	47.039032
here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives .	56.760426
otherwise , cross over the corso and walk a block or so to the left .	67.080574
you will come to alemagna , a delightful , though moderately expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries .	49.160015
either here , or in one of the modest restaurants nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of rome .	46.941303
the second walk through the heart of rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the pincian hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best .	44.753166
rare , indeed , is the harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality .	37.487476
i myself have witnessed and endured it more than once .	41.05218
the businessmen and racketeers also have a story .	3.4794836
( and this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss harlem ' s very complex attitude toward black policemen , nor the reasons , according to harlem , that they are nearly all downtown .	81.15806
it is hard , on the other hand , to blame the policeman , blank , good-natured , thoughtless , and insuperably innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves .	20.556126
he , too , believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed .	41.060875
he has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? ?	70.43556
-- and yet he is facing , daily and nightly , people who would gladly see him dead , and he knows it .	32.270542
there is no way for him not to know it there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people .	44.44494
he moves through harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country	23.342957
which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes .	20.739822
and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company the people who are watching him know why , too .	98.314125
any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination .	150.73668
and these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant , it speaks of the end of that domination .	75.873955
the white policeman standing on a harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world .	42.25227
he is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the anguish of the black people around him .	51.44882
even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in .	49.739567
he cannot avoid observing that some of the children , in spite of their color , remind him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children .	76.44848
he knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way .	166.64252
he can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature .	201.17513
he becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased .	73.17922
one day , to everyone ' s astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up .	63.084644
before the dust has settled or the blood congealed , editorials , speeches , and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land , demanding to know what happened .	19.623734
what happened is that negroes want to be treated like men .	118.806076
negroes want to be treated like men a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words .	98.88545
people who have mastered kant , hegel , shakespeare , marx , freud , and the bible find this statement utterly impenetrable .	38.5216
the idea seems to threaten profound , barely conscious assumptions .	106.564995
a kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place .	27.02475
i once tried to describe to a very well-known american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south .	133.56987
and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` why don ' t all the negroes in the south move north ' ' ? ?	29.17633
i tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of negroes move north .	344.6858
they do not escape jim crow they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety .	151.93173
they do not move to chicago , they move to the south side	47.35858
they do not move to new york , they move to harlem .	46.60124
the pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent .	93.51824
white people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal intimidation to physical violence .	40.31963
but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto .	13.848319
the white people fall back bitterly before the black horde	69.23278
the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep	16.392927
and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf ' ' .	9.329024
this is precisely what happened when the puerto ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as i write , being fought out all up and down those streets .	113.88015
they seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil war , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the south , without taking any responsibility for it	45.31227
and that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what is happening in little rock or birmingham is worse .	42.849724
well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is `` worse ' ' .	45.50178
i know negroes who prefer the south and white southerners , because `` at least there , you haven ' t got to play any guessing games ' ' ! !	48.53047
the guessing games referred to have driven more than one negro into the narcotics ward , the madhouse , or the river .	36.602165
i know another negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` the spirit of the south is the spirit of america ' ' .	38.479828
he was born in the north and did his military training in the south .	33.069485
he did not , as far as i can gather , find the south `` worse ' '	69.75765
he found it , if anything , all too familiar .	99.76192
in the second place , though , even if birmingham is worse , no doubt johannesburg , south africa , beats it by several miles , and buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world .	25.451847
but i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes .	37.306454
this perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling .	131.56348
the emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes .	50.208935
thirdly , the south is not merely an embarrassingly backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us .	40.325974
as far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the southern white and the northerner the southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of eden in which he loved black people and they loved him .	32.273228
historically , the flaming sword laid across this eden is the civil war .	28.056309
personally , it is the southerner ' s sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past .	99.64183
everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need .	57.79173
the resulting , indescribable torment affects every southern mind and is the basis of the southern hysteria .	35.322044
none of this is true for the northerner .	11.288123
negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality .	27.267435
northerners never think about them whereas southerners are never really thinking of anything else .	38.01167
negroes are , therefore , ignored in the north and are under surveillance in the south , and suffer hideously in both places .	45.92436
neither the southerner nor the northerner is able to look on the negro simply as a man .	50.613464
it seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many negroes , comparatively , bought cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) .	76.52401
they are two sides of the same coin and the south will not change -- cannot change -- until the north changes .	215.00356
the country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom .	97.76841
in the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us .	22.084173
it is a terrible , an inexorable , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one ' s own in the face of one ' s victim , one sees oneself .	45.631603
walk through the streets of harlem and see what we , this nation , have become .	121.63165
east river , downtown postscript to a letter from harlem	46.124714
the fact that american negroes rioted in the u . n . while adlai stevenson was addressing the assembly shocked and baffled most white americans .	21.892647
stevenson ' s speech , and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery , were both touched off by the death , in katanga , the day before , of patrice lumumba .	39.65587
stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the united states was `` against ' ' colonialism .	23.637308
god knows what the african nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the u . n . were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the u . s . abstention when the vote on algerian freedom was before the assembly -- but i think i have a fairly accurate notion of what the negroes in the gallery were thinking .	37.053085
it was my first reaction upon hearing of lumumba ' s death .	5.680939
i was curious about the impact of this political assassination on negroes in harlem , for lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there .	164.19044
i was curious to know if lumumba ' s death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from `` our ' ' side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric .	36.638496
and i was curious about the african reaction .	4.765735
however , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the u . n . gallery .	43.37961
had i been there , i , too , in the eyes of most americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the communists .	25.39729
the climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the `` cold ' ' war , have given americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination , and so it has been decided that the riots were `` communist ' ' inspired .	35.118294
nor was it long , naturally , before prominent negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the u . n . rioters do not represent the real feeling of the negro community .	30.295494
according , then , to what i take to be the prevailing view , these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible , stalinist-corrupted provocateurs .	22.91715
it is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict .	89.34689
one has only , for example , to walk through harlem and ask oneself two questions .	63.992558
the first question is would i like to live here ? ?	40.71531
and the second question is why don ' t those who now live here move out ? ?	69.28252
the answer to both questions is immediately obvious .	8.204231
unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that negroes are , somehow , different from white people , i do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the negro ' s status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability .	59.99254
now , i do not doubt that , among the people at the u . n . that day , there were stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives .	33.843796
wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found .	59.78373
their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity .	66.809494
what i find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the american assumption that the negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest .	61.35346
it is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated .	45.627186
color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties .	78.12997
movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .	24.52339
each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen .	61.012146
as long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further .	84.48306
motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as times square .	57.974445
brief snips of actual events were shown parades , dances , street scenes .	18.836752
the sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats .	26.586033
an early edison production was the execution of mary , queen of scots .	47.16849
an early film by a competitor of the wizard of menlo park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage .	64.55319
in the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one-minute shows .	82.700455
in response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day .	56.562653
despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story .	29.18925
moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .	33.292908
thus such great american documentaries as the river and the plow that broke the plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures .	98.83007
the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a french magician , georges melies , and an american employee of edison , edwin s . porter .	22.471277
of the two , porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands .	73.625626
melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film .	28.128658
one of these is the `` dissolve ' ' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .	53.711994
as the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear .	45.258007
for a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .	127.112404
in a series of fairy tales and fantasies , melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions .	36.19067
immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time .	166.17784
physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers ' ' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .	75.1942
linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement .	43.157127
the `` projection ' ' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions .	62.251175
the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know .	79.59586
the time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .	25.29288
the film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames ' ' , 35-mm . -wide .	13.206867
each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .	50.91214
time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time .	269.6606
now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .	123.30477
the `` moving ' ' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree	109.61871
the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo .	51.789967
in narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .	25.3874
almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time .	215.24194
this discovery of melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician ' s tricks produced on film .	40.955887
it was porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued .	88.43247
the movie was the great train robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable .	109.469635
overnight , for one thing , porter ' s film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten .	123.55521
the great train robbery is a one-reel film .	4.4910035
one reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of robbery , 1903 , until griffith shattered that limit forever with birth of a nation in 1915 .	53.645844
the reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .	50.583984
the material of the porter film is simplicity itself	2563.1748
much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old west -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950 ' s .	54.98616
a band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes .	21.671072
a posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out .	47.773144
the robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse .	31.390312
as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience .	79.38483
all this is simple enough , but in telling the story porter did two important things that had not been done before .	86.54048
each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , porter ' s camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play .	66.48642
the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen .	32.715252
if the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen .	57.218044
in that apparently simple shift porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device .	23.767498
he revealed the potential value of the `` cut ' ' as the basic technique in the art of the film .	24.563135
cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film .	21.89028
the meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with .	117.75987
the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .	50.809105
if , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .	61.69947
if , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child ' s grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film	59.186176
as the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher ' s little daughter arrives with her father ' s dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor .	53.314377
the two events are taking place at the same time .	6.2321215
we leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events , in `` reality ' ' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance .	58.109646
the `` chase ' ' as a standard film device probably dates from the great train robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device .	49.074867
it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both .	90.33463
the simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction .	69.09163
the cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence	31.806465
these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative .	32.2839
the creator of the art of the film d . w . griffith	23.764692
there still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .	60.472866
when he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .	73.826225
in about seven years griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker .	59.658314
before he was forty griffith had created the art of the film .	8.530034
not that there had not been attempts , mostly european , to do exactly that .	181.02507
but in general the european efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself .	46.624332
staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .	57.24135
great actors and actresses -- the most notable being sarah bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera .	46.989037
in all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author .	61.7799
the phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera .	30.525341
not surprisingly , this approach did not work .	7.1206584
the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names .	55.113106
but no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .	50.166862
in general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis	38.73775
congregational membership , however , is another thing .	18.57419
a congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership	27.621513
that is , when it can preserve economic integration .	2.1023066
religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining	95.58366
the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition .	45.82673
the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches .	51.36277
central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes	55.69218
( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition .	17.498028
the central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations they have too few middle-class people	70.992256
central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities .	34.712086
with few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city .	55.850067
the key to protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation .	14.8420515
members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes	184.22035
but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum .	19.734728
the congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood	53.78859
moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive	40.9495
they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration .	20.634716
the congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group	619.9506
it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship .	7.12452
if it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the new protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do .	28.03693
they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .	4.575066
the vulnerability of protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit ' ' of protestant religious life	30.063784
in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal ' ' roman catholic parish .	29.639925
we have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers	36.101784
consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in protestant congregations	66.21669
actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection .	87.807945
the vulnerability of protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration .	29.541498
this fact is evident in the recruitment of new members .	25.377518
the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .	20.152369
there is much talk in theological circles about the `` church as mission ' ' and the `` church ' s mission ' '	16.127539
theologians have been stressing the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .	25.561522
a crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism .	66.55886
if economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration .	37.991547
the task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .	25.738531
( co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy	12.198118
it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization .	58.185562
) in a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment	37.488827
this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation	24.161133
therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated .	49.585773
evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches	55.184025
one study in pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .	42.210102
in a sample of new members of pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members ' ' .	33.148525
if we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church ' ' ( 11 . 2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .	59.78798
on the surface , this seems a sound approach to christian mission members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people	77.14497
the new people respond in kind by joining the church .	8.972731
missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods	133.51848
the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position	35.390965
association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations .	15.028796
this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation	25.860336
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation	27.803408
the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation .	9.937646
churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration	41.839672
once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going .	139.79665
the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members .	34.459614
the proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17 . 3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .	33.631203
publicity accounted for 1 . 1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members .	11.930806
in general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church	51.648018
economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood .	124.27233
the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together	36.777374
the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership .	53.844482
economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation .	48.437267
in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation .	51.66144
the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance .	48.19251
the expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society	72.80163
nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the protestant development .	20.105028
it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings .	41.98292
these trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .	7.020913
residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .	4.934658
the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized	264.6995
the schism between central city and suburb , negro and white , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .	15.398452
it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings .	20.924212
the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations .	12.844556
this conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .	21.607609
more than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples .	24.573597
since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis .	26.925823
consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests .	18.426094
negroes , puerto ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities .	105.765396
soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century .	77.46098
the identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .	30.45566
mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion .	29.671446
this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .	40.926662
it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes .	38.770134
it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities .	49.77703
whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .	37.97269
attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches	128.23178
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .	17.820026
the keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .	56.53846
these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations .	34.029762
`` fellowship by likeness ' ' and `` mission by friendly contact ' ' form the iron cage of denominational religion .	69.47479
its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation .	26.0354
what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church .	31.168444
an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity .	27.01968
the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need .	59.174496
with capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue .	117.498505
the directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company .	159.68744
these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers .	22.131311
the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to france in company ships .	52.15292
the company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show .	50.76307
in accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians .	50.38173
the lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men .	50.91895
traders from the english colonies were far more generous , and indian loyalty turned to them .	21.144411
protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company .	51.370403
in 1721 the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony .	60.988964
they ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75 , 000 livres with which to build forts .	29.57917
they adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts .	38.577103
in each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses .	62.879368
for southeastern louisiana , mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by british traders .	35.446697
mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the tennessee river .	13.697218
fort toulouse , on the alabama river , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas and choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present nashville , tennessee , and this was soon abandoned .	42.697876
west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi district , of which new orleans was headquarters .	65.75301
dependent upon it were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of new spain .	16.848135
on the middle mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas .	21.284803
it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the arkansas river .	46.719048
on the ohio or wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers ' ' .	35.71357
other posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication with canada .	71.09507
on the upper mississippi the illinois post was to be established near kaskaskia , and dependent posts were to be built on the missouri , `` where there are mines in abundance ' ' .	27.522205
each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at new orleans .	23.238367
an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way .	32.838127
concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors .	14.450909
engages must be loyal to the concessionaires , and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended .	84.509094
the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires .	13.7642975
only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at mobile , the other at new orleans .	67.890625
new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi , and west of that river , and on the ohio and wabash .	40.19241
mobile was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district .	33.011517
the power that bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined .	50.421505
regulations for the indian trade were made by the conseil superieure de la louisiane , and bienville apparently did not have control of that body .	39.62369
the conseil even treated the serious matter of british aggression as its business and , on its own authority , sent to disaffected savages merchandise `` suitable for the peltry trade ' ' .	52.24326
it decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of bienville were insufficient , and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen carolinians .	18.382544
during the first administration of bienville , the peltry trade of the mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue .	16.92191
the alabamas brought in annually 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 deerskins , and the choctaws and chickasaws brought the total up to 50 , 000 pelts .	23.091244
these deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather , and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods .	88.98265
during his first administration , bienville succeeded in keeping carolina traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country .	17.233912
the director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the indian needs .	68.94629
the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply .	75.0312
de la laude , commander of the alabama post , had the friendship of the natives , and was able to make them look upon the british as poor competitors .	46.66608
diron d ' artaguette , the most prominent trader in the district , was energetic and resourceful , but his methods often aroused the ire of the french governors .	27.056805
he became , after a time , commander of a post on the alabama river , but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade .	25.467155
the chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district .	17.78166
their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the alabama , the tombigbee , the tennessee , and cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees .	12.906089
in 1720 some chickasaws massacred the french traders among them , and did not make peace for four years .	54.56612
venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the french markets .	27.589708
british traders from south carolina incited the indians against the french , and there developed french and british factions in the tribe .	35.57652
the chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana .	106.40083
to hold them was an essential part of french policy , for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile .	46.844234
they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french settlements near the gulf .	80.4661
bienville realized that if the french were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british goods , french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the carolinians and at reasonable prices .	23.381762
the company of the indies promised to send over a supply of indian trading goods , and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins .	23.464003
but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country .	86.72137
the insistence of bienville upon giving liberal prices to the indians , in order to drive back the carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 .	42.44028
for two years his friend and cousin , boisbriant , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance .	194.02356
although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders , and even kill some of them , the carolina advance continued .	42.56154
the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina , and when perier came over as governor in 1727 , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district .	29.503351
but the company of the indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices .	103.79442
to the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy .	19.27035
perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the indians .	59.112366
these agents were to ascertain the difference between english and french goods , and the prices charged the indians .	35.280937
they were to conciliate the unfriendly savages , and , wherever possible , to incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina .	18.232616
they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men , as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering .	53.184868
one was british and the other , french .	31.468407
so hostile did these factions become that , among the choctaws , civil war broke out .	29.039532
perier ' s efforts , however , were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country .	39.240417
he asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to arrest english traders and disloyal indians .	38.718838
in spite of the company ' s restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory .	38.600536
he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians ' pelts .	35.034023
no help came from the crown , and perier , in desperation , gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to d ' artaguette .	25.625996
d ' artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters .	157.97173
but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts , and soon french trade in the region was at an end .	39.857548
perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in france .	21.396149
the indians were not impressed and held to the carolina traders , who swarmed over the country , almost to the mississippi .	23.754921
with the loss of the mobile trade , which ended all profits from louisiana , the natchez indians revolted .	18.882765
they destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed french shipping on the mississippi .	17.036627
the war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts .	15.875846
in january , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony .	17.281965
it stated that it had lost 20 , 000 , 000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the indian trade .	32.928623
it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity .	47.996292
the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1 , 450 , 000 livres .	13.0497465
thenceforth , the commerce of louisiana was free to all frenchmen .	22.943342
company rule in louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies .	9.917124
the difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families .	50.962536
others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the indian trade .	33.869076
if this trade should be resumed , the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans , and soldiers discharged from the army , must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois .	30.704006
this was a slow and difficult course , and french trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders .	61.063313
perier and salmon , the intendant , wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts .	45.75154
bienville , who returned to succeed perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits .	36.50187
he reported , too , that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the king ' s goods .	17.625578
he did find some to trust , however , and he employed the king ' s soldiers to trade .	21.695204
with no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders .	54.854122
in order to compete with english traders , bienville radically changed the price schedule .	91.28192
the king should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders .	64.541405
they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury ' s expense .	52.601456
they would be particularly displeased with the state department if it were the source of such reports .	35.317505
few things are more perilous for the state department than a displeased congressman .	27.453026
the reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are so available .	73.37895
first , the state department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters .	88.85393
the farmers may be aroused if congress cuts into the agriculture department ' s budget .	14.028713
businessmen will rise if congress attacks the commerce department .	24.227251
the chamber of commerce , assaults upon the treasury .	13.089393
a kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the department of health , education , and welfare .	36.65106
the congressman ' s patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the defense department .	42.02709
tampering with the post office may infuriate every voter who can write .	20.398678
with all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly .	110.1829
no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the state department in anger .	33.490208
in many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .	83.804985
after all , the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer , the laborer , or the businessman , but to foreigners .	37.65104
not only do these foreigners not vote for american congressmen	176.76082
they are also probably ungrateful for uncle ' s sam ' s bounty .	11.05068
and are not the state department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll ? ?	50.92746
will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with america and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes ? ?	42.90814
the result is that the state department ' s perpetual position before congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife .	39.419228
people in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers .	32.04757
the department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion .	36.670807
state is expected to arrange the touring cicero ' s foreign itinerary	16.784262
its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way	60.910202
embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim , frequently with their savings for the children ' s college tuition .	33.939995
but come the next session of congress , state can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats .	158.90408
the congressman who , in paris , may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of notre-dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the treasury .	37.15995
in the matter of money state ' s most unrelenting watchdog during the eisenhower years was representative john j . rooney , of brooklyn , who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses .	33.89555
diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence , not with nikita khrushchev , but with john rooney .	45.804497
in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring rooney around -- friendly persuasion , groveling abasement , pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen , tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps .	50.278763
`` the trouble , ' ' explained loy henderson , then deputy undersecretary for administration , `` is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing , it always turns out that rooney knows more about our budget than we do ' ' .	62.80362
one year the department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government ' s entertainment bills out of personal income .	81.69756
next day , reports went through the department that rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that , that year , expense allowances would not rise a dollar .	99.314575
the department ' s constant fight with the house for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the senate .	60.754234
armed with constitutional power to negate the executive ' s foreign policy , the senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the state department ' s back , or on the head of the secretary of state .	35.369194
with its power to investigate , the senate can paralyze the secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees , as it did with dean acheson .	43.11431
john foster dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson , who was then operating the senate , refused to let it become an inquisition .	50.042896
during dulles ' s first two years in office , while republicans ran the senate , the department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 .	44.10236
an internal police operation managed by scott mcleod , a former f . b . i . man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence , was part of the vengeance .	52.24883
so was the attack upon charles e . bohlen when eisenhower appointed him ambassador to moscow .	88.37914
the principal mauler , however , was senator joseph mccarthy .	8.206999
where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the department , dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates .	39.282627
fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way .	38.3198
in view of eisenhower ' s reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the terror , it is doubtful that heroic intervention by dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country ' s foreign policy .	28.107037
in any event , the example of acheson ' s trampling by the senate did not encourage dulles to provoke it .	16.413828
he elected to `` get along ' ' .	3.0966954
during this dark chapter in state department history , men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol hill .	92.042786
their old errors of judgment were equated , in the curious logic of the time , with present treasonous intent .	35.01409
their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas .	106.695305
this , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the democrats took control .	150.01654
in the new style , the department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the russians .	31.268812
for three or four years in the mid-1950 ' s , this complaint was heard rumbling up from the senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon .	19.901606
it became smart to say that the fault was with dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself .	96.76369
an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the senate ' s own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation .	34.16892
there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in washington .	28.172995
they range from the soviet embassy on sixteenth street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what congressman rooney has called `` that monstrosity on thirty-fourth street ' ' , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the belgians .	21.362787
here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter , of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini , of the poseur , the spy , the party crasher , and the patriot , of the rented tails , the double cross , and the tired lothario .	16.283783
into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle uncle sam in an infinite variety of contingencies .	43.327904
here are hatched plans for getting a share of the american bounty , the secret of the anti-missile missile , or an invitation to dinner .	15.90701
out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside washington .	77.11397
some , like the british and the french , maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the american scene .	66.55189
other embassies cable home the new york times without changing a comma .	39.551373
the soviet embassy is popularly regarded as russian espionage headquarters .	27.72406
when ambassador mikhail menshikov took it over in 1957 from georgi zaroubin , he made a determined effort to change this idea .	48.706024
menshikov hit washington with a tv announcer ' s grin and a hearty handclasp .	7.019179
to everyone ' s astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine russian ambassador than george babbitt was like fyodor pavlovitch karamazov .	53.152443
where his predecessors had glowered , menshikov smiled .	49.59971
where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers ' assistants , menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails .	25.796188
overnight he became the most available man in washington .	20.683199
speeches by the soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural maryland rotarians and national press club alike .	86.94869
in senator joseph mccarthy ' s phrase , it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of .	44.890285
a newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked menshikov `` what should we call you ' ' ? ?	18.59314
and that menshikov replied `` just call me mike ' ' .	12.561607
`` smilin ' mike ' ' was the sobriquet washington gave him .	231.47554
his english was usable and he used it fearlessly .	3.5437596
toasting in champagne one night at the embassy , he hoisted his glass to a senator ' s wife and gaily cried `` up your bottom ' ' ! !	23.005096
for a few giddy months that coincided with one of moscow ' s smiling moods , he was the sensation of washington .	13.84918
at the state department , hard-bitten russian experts complained that the capitol was out of its wits .	26.685524
newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that judas , too , had been able to smile .	21.984758
the menshikov interlude ended as larks with the russians usually end .	474.41757
finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics , moscow resumed scowling and `` smilin ' mike ' ' dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the middle west .	28.303179
the most inscrutable embassies are the arabs ' , and the most inscrutable of the arabs are the saudi arabians .	12.239162
when king saud visited washington , the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family .	142.34502
rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds .	41.269848
the state department was little help on this , or on much else about saudi arabia .	60.13138
a reporter who consulted a middle east information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the state department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the arabian-american oil company .	55.000637
`` this is where i get my information from ' ' , he confided .	63.41199
it ' s the only copy i ' ve got ' ' .	5.627185
the size of saud ' s family was still being debated when the king appeared for his first meeting with eisenhower .	43.673584
when it ended , a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into hagerty ' s office to report on the interview .	9.625832
the massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about saudi-american friendship to bore in on the central question .	83.66907
how many children did the king have ? ?	1.1803676
`` twenty-one ' ' , replied the sheik .	34.44945
and how many of these were sons ? ?	1.0117323
`` twenty-five ' ' , the sheik replied .	7.1457033
`` do you mean to tell us ' ' , a reporter asked , `` that the king has twenty-one children , twenty-five of whom are sons ' ' ? ?	14.130589
the sheik smiled and murmured `` that is precisely correct ' ' .	43.45483
the egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language .	6.806885
when dag hammarskjold was negotiating the middle east peace after israel ' s 1956 invasion of egypt , he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of cairo , a language as anarchic as casey stengel ' s .	36.612988
the reports of president nasser ' s pledges which hammarskjold was relaying from cairo to washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats , including the israeli foreign minister , mrs . golda meir .	12.958437
finally he reported that nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for israeli concessions .	52.62421
the deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside .	34.298058
i know now why our japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom .	62.63838
of course , most toilets are eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside .	88.924324
a few newer homes have western flush toilets , but even with running water , they are usually eastern style .	67.47986
the next day i visited international christian college which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know japan well .	81.55231
they are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning .	60.16537
the library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom .	5.6175933
spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be christian .	26.082499
they have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates .	85.84499
in the afternoon miss hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young mrs . kodama to see the famous spring dances of the geisha dancers .	42.03826
mrs . hosaka is one of the japanese women one reads about -- beautiful , artistically talented , an artful manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ) , and yet looking like a pampered , gentle japanese woman .	58.189255
the dances were as beautiful as anything i have ever seen -- they rival the new york rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination .	42.923878
because don was leaving the next day , i spent the evening with him at asia center .	70.02152
the following morning mr . morikawa called for me , and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten , middle-school , elementary school , and high school -- mr . yoshimoto ' s school .	26.918385
there is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected -- some think too much .	356.19412
there is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools .	26.514116
with the loss of the emperor diety in japan , the people are left in confusion with no god or moral teachings that have strength .	76.95914
the older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles , but the younger people , who have lost all faith and convictions , are now parents .	63.937897
there seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability .	84.83038
as a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value .	78.916405
the government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused .	88.59087
i was told that it is quite likely that japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they ? ?	80.43438
it will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop .	178.55913
in the evening the former oregon state science teachers met for dinner at the new tokyo restaurant where i had my first raw fish and found it good .	69.490326
they suggested several new foods , and usually i found them good , except the sweets , which i think i could learn to like .	62.25889
six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun .	57.81003
after a day at nikko , mrs . kodama put me on the train for kyoto .	22.95173
my instructions were that mr . nishimo would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome .	62.77997
my hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by masu and the japan travel bureau and were more elegant than i would have chosen , but it was fun for once to be elegant -- i did explain to the students , however , that this was not my usual style , for their salaries are very small , and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well .	60.051006
they understood and teased me a bit about it .	9.452861
i think i would have been much disappointed in japan if i had not seen kyoto , nara , and hiroshima .	31.359755
kyoto is the ancient capital of japan and still its cultural center .	132.76147
it , along with nara , was untouched by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar japan .	20.794344
here i was accompanied by mrs . okamoto ( fumio ' s mother ) , her son , mr . washizu ( a prospective student with whom i have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and mr . nishima , one of the science teachers .	35.475433
i arrived at 7 00 a . m . and by 9 00 a . m . i had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned .	48.911495
we walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens .	16.479486
we visited the okamoto home -- where for the first time i saw the famous tea ceremony .	21.333456
at 6 00 p . m . we went to the kyoto spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated .	54.396305
they were even better than those of tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative .	54.894913
after a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of mt . fuji ) , i returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day .	28.573317
we started at 9 a . m . to visit the kyoto university where mr . washizu is attending .	18.979767
i was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school .	98.67764
they apologized for the condition , including dirt and flies , and i was a little at a loss to know what to say .	51.05028
i don ' t have the answer yet .	9.292464
we had tea at mr . washizu ' s home where i learned that he , too , comes from a very wealthy family .	39.122276
and he , being the eldest , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do differently , and one of his brothers is to become the priest .	27.436739
this is a significant fact in japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice .	33.464092
in his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big .	116.36824
also , there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings , lacquer , brocade , etc . .	15.244672
he had displayed more of them than usual so that i could enjoy them .	57.91794
about 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum .	21.329126
the house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older , less-hurried times .	54.574383
mr . nishima went with me on the train to nara .	18.090693
we passed his house and school on the way .	54.228302
in nara i stayed at the hotel where the prince and princess had stayed on their honeymoon .	14.365085
a new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but i walked on it , too .	61.975315
here mr . yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches .	19.14615
even though we had walked miles in kyoto that day , we started out again to see nara at night .	37.465527
in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to osaka to put me on the train for hiroshima .	51.11245
again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn ' t let me .	22.64683
at osaka , mr . yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home , but mr . nishima and i had an hour and a half before train time to see osaka at night .	66.48965
it is the second largest city in japan , with about four million people .	76.12923
one spot in osaka i shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river .	47.89602
in the midst of a great busy city , people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light .	101.64295
my train arrived in hiroshima at the awful hour of 4 45 a . m . .	18.507265
i had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little , after which mr . uno would arrive and pilot me around .	88.22092
but there he was at the train with an oregon state pennant in his hand .	69.78463
i know now why the students insisted that i go to hiroshima even when i told them i didn ' t want to .	42.59753
they knew that i was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if i could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret pearl harbor , i would be happier and would understand better a new japan .	46.478176
there were no words to say this but there was no need .	24.783205
the teachers of mr . uno ' s school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming .	58.793
hiroshima is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people i met was a strong determination for peace and understanding .	49.66509
i was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience .	41.72769
a better world may yet come out of hiroshima .	78.67286
on arriving in tokyo later we were met by masu who took us immediately to her university , the japanese women ' s university .	39.962894
this day was `` open house for parents ' ' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables .	44.39866
everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun .	83.75146
it was thrilling to see the effect of an american-trained teacher on japanese students in a class in home planning .	34.529945
our masu is one of the very few architects in japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women ' s needs .	96.28855
i am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work , and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants .	53.263138
many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in american homes , but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using japanese artfulness in our own western architecture at the same time that the japanese are adopting western utility patterns .	52.260166
at this women ' s university we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that japanese women also should be educated .	64.274025
even today there are some doubts about the value of education for japanese women , but this university continues to grow and to send its students out into the community .	60.429657
active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings .	54.064957
as far as i am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions .	52.807266
masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for japanese widows in tokyo .	28.906097
here the women learn to keep house as maids	287.70822
they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests .	95.02025
they learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family .	36.00693
they have model kitchens , a sick room with a model patient in bed , and a nursery with a life-like doll .	17.232962
although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough .	20.122631
graduates of this maid ' s school are much in demand and can always find work immediately .	228.01674
masu ' s home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials .	205.33252
masu also uses the training she got in an american home where she learned to polish furniture , clean corners , and work effectively in keeping a shiny house .	43.411743
her education in the united states , not just in a classroom , but also in an american house with an american housekeeper , stands her in good stead .	49.675713
after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria , the kitchen of which masu had planned , mr . washizu and i left to meet representatives of the usis for a visit to the university of tokyo .	40.40037
here again it was vacation time and there were many things i could not see , but i was able to visit with a professor who is famous in japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant .	61.827934
the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between attorney general rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should , of course , be applauded .	71.00516
but for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case .	70.722
the suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the south , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in new york and general company policy .	90.6731
then the boycott would not be secondary , but a primary one .	87.758385
it would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which , for love ' s sake and for the sake of justice , must be removed , and , indivisible from this , to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy .	35.13753
perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order , by threatening potential injury to its entire economy , to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation .	45.243507
such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument , and therefore of questionable justification .	48.52079
action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate .	81.20289
moreover , prudence alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs , leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the quakers , who once had many meetings in the pre-civil war south , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to recover a large number of southern adherents ) .	65.07382
in any case , anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by white citizens ' councils in the entire state of mississippi against every local philco dealer in that state , in protest against a philco-sponsored program over a national tv network on which was presented a drama showing , it seemed , a `` high yellow gal ' ' smooching with a white man .	89.69955
it is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different .	70.66007
but since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force .	121.56787
the need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that white citizens ' councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence .	85.358284
an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means .	58.536537
the end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights , e . g . , against negroes who register to vote in fayette county , tennessee , at the present moment .	44.44436
here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies .	45.57438
this , however , is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used .	75.09927
it is also sufficient to show the christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just , i . e . , that , if economic pressure has to be resorted to , this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices , while , if injury fall upon others , it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily ( however inevitably ) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them .	81.55285
it is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in christian morality , like any other form of resistance .	40.94518
the language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ) .	69.90723
one of the sit-in leaders has said `` nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom of hell can stop the march to freedom .	83.03046
everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them ' ' .	108.26049
the present writer certainly agrees with that statement , and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice .	49.047836
however , it is also a christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward .	43.41596
and when charity interpenetrates man ' s struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will .	119.61621
it also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means .	55.34047
r . b . gregg has written that `` non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu , to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance .	60.803993
he suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him ' '	21.809492
and again , that `` the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely , to demoralize the opponent , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope .	37.502274
in another respect it is dissimilar , for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values ' ' .	25.174372
a trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent	53.458042
and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause .	62.851074
this makes necessary a morality of means , and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified .	58.902576
the question , then , is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him .	21.815878
here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives	135.80908
and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently .	61.498386
a technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression .	135.6612
among christian groups , the mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the christian use of all forms of pressure .	36.9668
since the will and word of god are for them concentrated in christ-like love , it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing .	35.329945
`` the primary objective of non-violence ' ' , writes the outstanding mennonite ethicist , `` is not peace , or obedience to the divine will , but rather certain desired social changes , for personal , or class , or national advantage ' ' .	85.79834
without agreeing with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the mennonite position and affirm that christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance .	65.11169
economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified	121.83499
and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means , and apply to both alike , justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action .	73.62046
economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed .	42.806328
that would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals .	61.16292
there must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or non-violent .	47.423233
the justification in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed , those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall , and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good .	80.875
in these terms , the `` economic withdrawal ' ' of the negroes of nashville , tennessee , from trading in the center city , for example , was clearly justified , since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out .	49.300873
we may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above .	163.86649
there may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people .	48.274937
an excellent article was published recently in the journal of the church peace union by a south african journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in south africa , amounting to virtual slavery , and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the united states in these conditions .	37.804214
`` billions of american dollars , not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of u . s . taxpayers ' ' , this author states , `` are being poured into south africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression , the persecution , and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white ' ' .	46.041443
both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail .	27.547382
this leads to the conclusion that `` the fact is inescapable that america does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue ' ' .	84.93359
our leadership in a wide economic boycott of south africa would be not only in accord , it seems , with the moral conscience of america , not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country , but also in accord with our law , u . s . code title 19 , section 1307 , which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor .	43.033264
not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , `` must surely be supported by every american who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation ' ' .	68.22706
northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration .	81.59778
they have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .	73.85566
and both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners who are called bourbons .	92.50487
the name presumably derives from the french royal house which never learned and never forgot	343.24704
since bourbon whiskey , though of kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the north as by conservatives in the south .	23.637836
the nature of the opposition between liberals and bourbons is too little understood in the north .	35.11426
the race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive .	82.84961
it is these other differences between north and south -- other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which i chiefly discuss herein .	153.1108
i write about northern liberals from considerable personal experience .	23.475325
a southerner married to a new englander , i have lived for many years in a connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes .	33.77925
most of them are democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .	109.17256
this is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government .	58.402683
yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view jefferson as one of their patron saints .	20.805725
when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , i find that they fall into two categories the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis	82.964485
and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don ' t count any more in the world of to-day .	30.447407
i am naive , they say , to make use of such words .	85.08735
i take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ? ?	41.938267
-- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it .	85.507706
this seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a president of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court .	43.90168
as for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms .	65.60804
the american liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case	39.473717
but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .	37.979465
why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ? ?	58.53366
if he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? ?	49.654896
and if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? ?	112.024185
i am concerned here , however , with the northern liberal ' s attitude toward the south .	22.705803
it appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of southern friends .	42.02181
his assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views .	66.60792
time ' s editor , thomas griffith , in his book , the waist-high culture , wrote `` most of what was different about it ( the deep south ) i found myself unsympathetic to .	57.61588
' ' this , for the liberals i know , would be an understatement .	27.008713
theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against fascism .	21.139341
i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the north .	59.009037
in business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found .	27.418121
but in our case -- and neither my wife nor i have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more .	102.243965
in fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down .	68.10777
accounts have been published of northern liberals in the south up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .	54.913525
but these accounts do not show that northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings .	28.009363
from my wife ' s experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles .	53.08484
but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the south , especially among those who studied in the north .	56.240593
and social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting northerners .	62.94426
also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent southern attitude on most social problems .	136.84781
but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven ' t .	34.467396
my definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the north won the war .	28.663162
nobody knows how many southerners there are in this category .	13.676637
i suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the north likes to believe .	42.974476
i never heard of a poll being taken on the question .	12.318465
no doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic .	12.078424
prior to 1954 i imagine that a majority of southerners would have voted against the confederacy .	16.489025
since the supreme court ' s decision of that year this is more doubtful	82.1153
and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to little rock i believe the majority would have been for the old south .	66.362
belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones .	72.861115
probably a larger percentage of virginians and south carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with georgia , north carolina , and alabama following along after them .	42.992092
old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the tidewater than the piedmont	8.403013
so that a line running down the length of the south marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the old south from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves .	46.544308
the long-settled areas of states like virginia and south carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .	45.450657
also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on charleston had closer ties with england and the west indies than with the north even after independence .	49.895054
the social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .	23.820333
in certain respects defeat increased the persistent anglophilia of the old south .	19.308336
poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .	45.718666
and no doubt many people in states like the carolinas and georgia , which were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the crown .	23.660215
among bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .	140.43303
but many historians maintain that except for northern meddling it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did .	121.19934
southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and reconstruction	129.3633
their fears now are of miscegenation and negro political control in many counties .	102.04991
but apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed south -- to use the moderate words favored by mr . thomas griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the north .	76.96662
and this , in effect , means most of modern america .	57.048508
it is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .	94.005035
and therein , i feel , many northerners delude themselves about the south .	19.642624
for one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed .	307.73145
there seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .	93.475845
i suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking don ' t talk about the final stages of reconstruction and they will take care of themselves .	29.775946
or else the north really believes that all southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at heart sharers of the american dream , like everybody else .	56.46685
if the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .	23.65206
the situation of the south since 1865 has been unique in the western world .	8.398435
regardless of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre-world-war- 1 great power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike .	166.64847
and the great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or celtic descent .	60.2625
this is the only case in modern history of a people of britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination .	172.01768
the fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold .	108.03518
in every war of the united states since the civil war the south was more belligerent than the rest of the country .	11.083924
so instead of being tests of the south ' s loyalty , the spanish war , the two world wars , and the korean war all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion .	28.151575
and there is no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold war against communism .	39.472713
had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , england been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to new england , there is little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have happily put on their old confederate uniforms to fight as allies of britain .	44.52245
it is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as southerners should have been as docile as they have .	38.02794
the north should thank its stars that such has been the case	126.58654
but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .	50.67606
the two main charges levelled against the bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .	26.784374
there is much truth in both these charges , and not many bourbons deny them .	42.145473
whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .	8.119626
most of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure .	53.350235
many northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .	92.73792
the bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of northern conservatives .	70.06778
but those among the bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .	171.9292
they believe that if the south had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern america .	112.24993
as it is , they consider that the north is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` american way ' ' has been proved inferior to the english and scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .	31.255249
the south ' s antipathy to northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .	45.0406
their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to southerners	147.09398
and i have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .	63.84662
in the past , the duties of the state , as sir henry maine noted long ago , were only two in number internal order and external security .	139.37845
by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders .	36.489895
outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior ' ' peoples of the non-western world , a position of dominance .	22.691847
it became the sole `` subject ' ' of `` international law ' ' ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western nations could do in the world arena .	42.952595
( that corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .	28.596426
speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the western powers .	30.634827
the enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era .	42.366943
beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally .	50.18171
this was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires .	9.734521
that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman .	80.00591
his duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated .	52.5999
thus , to cite but one example , the pax britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the british navy ruling the seas or with the city of london ruling world finance , was strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e . g . , the united states ) may have incidentally benefited .	57.153446
at the same time , all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted .	64.32796
social darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century .	67.91436
however , in recent decades , for what doubtless are multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity .	69.335495
a concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment .	25.847225
already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters .	21.049969
a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned an important corner .	179.54723
in what has aptly been called a `` constitutional revolution ' ' , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the `` night-watchman state ' ' ) to one with affirmative duties to perform .	55.028072
the `` positive state ' ' came into existence .	39.666668
for lawyers , reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences , there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the supreme court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in `` the switch in time that saved nine ' ' , president roosevelt ' s ill-starred but in effect victorious `` court-packing plan ' ' , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation .	47.623
of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the american people .	136.69664
labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms , and all the many facets of the american version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom .	44.910336
a national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary .	50.440014
ratified in the republican party victory in 1952 , the positive state is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be .	103.53051
the general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i . e . , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the american people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in american constitutional history .	29.311201
the other , of course , was the civil war , the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation .	143.18883
a third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed american immersion and involvement in world affairs .	62.299606
internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented .	53.465244
nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both facets of the new concept .	98.9688
thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces ' ' to operate and cure the distress .	63.691235
that guiding principle of the hoover administration fell to the siege guns of the new deal	38.6222
less than a score of years later congress enacted the employment act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment .	44.403614
hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution .	37.524124
in 1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` state ' s-responsibility ' ' proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus .	67.12962
the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 .	36.6774
internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the industrial revolution .	26.122122
reduced to its simplest terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era .	24.224785
national responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or even to the western nations .	24.341331
a measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the international congress of jurists in 1959 .	23.287317
meeting in new delhi under the auspices of the international commission of jurists , a body of lawyers from the free world , the congress redefined and expanded the traditional rule of law to include affirmative governmental duties .	24.273493
it is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations .	101.10248
the rule of law , historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court ' ' before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare .	67.5543
recognizing that the rule of law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society ' ' , the congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized ' ' .	40.216164
the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-soviet world .	26.81929
for better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being .	70.056854
whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation ' s external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish .	60.905994
the hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition .	67.24843
the content is not the same , however rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group ' ' -- those in the `` free world ' ' -- that is basic .	35.48617
external national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations .	67.69653
if internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .	41.351723
reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle .	31.786377
in its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the church .	43.390106
the breakup of the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .	20.497698
( since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the united states as an independent entity , it is perhaps natural for americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging .	37.924297
) the concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure .	32.016933
for it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit .	55.11339
today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world .	30.393694
almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm .	25.528202
historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the western civilizational group .	50.785576
by subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has , to some degree at least , broadened the capacity for individual liberty .	41.235744
within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace , thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied .	88.21242
while the pattern is uneven , some having gained more than others , nationalism has in fact served the western peoples well .	158.96706
( whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today ' s nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions .	88.3189
it is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ) .	42.920826
but it is more than irony one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet .	101.76142
in other words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population	150.48337
it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis .	2.6288836
complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty .	20.775515
the former receives its legitimacy from the latter .	6.9226174
operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state .	112.350494
while sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern .	62.404648
jean bodin , writing in the sixteenth century , may have been the seminal thinker , but it was the vastly influential john austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood .	44.30043
austin ' s nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today ' s legal and political thinking .	78.53325
to him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the english monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i . e . , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations .	32.996445
these fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power .	42.639706
the nation-state , then , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control .	98.3513
in fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined .	15.04054
high-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision .	302.06546
that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular ' ' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split .	78.866035
nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world .	27.715399
is there a different reality behind the facade ? ?	11.329346
does the surface hide a quite different picture ? ?	4.8391004
the short answer to those questions is `` yes ' ' .	5.8958344
to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility .	16.162352
as evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances .	48.43966
can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? ?	39.396595
what steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ?	20.19248
are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ?	76.770386
is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ?	25.661524
i have just asked these questions in the pentagon , in the white house , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` sherwood forest ' ' .	23.417221
i asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons ' ' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons .	41.726017
to the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow ' s impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched .	16.547575
there is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate .	118.90185
`` readiness exercises ' ' are almost continuous .	31.835611
in the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since `` e hour ' ' .	37.8828
`` e ' ' stands for `` execution ' ' -- the moment a `` go order ' ' would unleash an american nuclear strike .	55.63233
there is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks .	46.85106
they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines .	39.85106
they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .	7.2637177
accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks .	82.08097
among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their `` hardware ' ' , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man ' s flair for what the professionals in this field call `` scenarios ' ' .	26.268673
as an air force psychiatrist put it `` you can ' t have dry runs on this one ' ' .	49.30682
the experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will -- but possibly might .	189.7369
only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men the more highly placed they are -- that is , the more they know -- the more concerned they have become .	128.84526
already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security .	55.460323
only recently new `` holes ' ' were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more .	123.57447
work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons .	31.833155
meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by `` false pre-emption ' ' , `` escalation ' ' , `` unauthorized behavior ' ' and other terms that will be discussed in this report .	17.112284
they inhabit a secret world centered on `` go codes ' ' and `` gold phones ' ' .	8.6377735
their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures -- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions .	22.711868
one arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm `` theirs ' ' .	47.1317
yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me -- and the experts .	111.356
it is their job to think about the unthinkable .	46.049072
unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more russians and communist chinese , too -- thought about accidental war .	88.95117
the first systematic thinking about this pandora ' s box within pandora ' s boxes was done four years ago by fred ikle , a frail , meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist .	15.965099
he was , and is , with the rand corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the u . s . air force .	9.762311
his investigations made him the paul revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased .	68.85591
in recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the kennedy administration , basic united states strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible .	60.986668
the chain starts at bmews ( ballistic missile early warning system ) in thule , greenland .	33.574608
its radar screens would register soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states .	21.876093
bmews intelligence is simultaneously flashed to norad ( north american air defense command ) in colorado springs , colorado , for interpretation	48.706444
to the sac command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air force base , near omaha , nebraska	14.602426
to the joint war room of the joint chiefs of staff in the pentagon and to the president .	10.285795
telephones , teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points .	75.55588
alternate locations exist for all key command centers .	3.4233503
for last-ditch emergencies sac has alternate command posts on kc-135 jet tankers .	2.9027257
multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible .	36.131348
the same principle of `` redundancy ' ' applies to all communications on these special networks .	41.986046
and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources .	21.579128
additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications .	8.380517
only the president is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons .	9.869303
but what if somebody decides to break it ? ?	9.760556
the president cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger .	160.33727
hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons .	9.134977
what if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the russians ? ?	42.856037
what if the president himself , in the language of the military , `` goes ape ' ' ? ?	13.640093
or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the soviets without provocation ? ?	35.410522
nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers .	10.360849
however , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war .	30.038172
even the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a `` go ' ' order .	38.979782
even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the `` go code ' ' .	24.620787
in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the `` gold-phone circuit ' ' .	13.237391
a system of `` gold ' ' -- actually yellow -- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the secretary of defense , the joint chiefs of staff , the sac commander and other key men .	41.749245
all can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes .	42.491547
all could help the president make his decision .	2.9660518
the talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble .	32.373486
vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda .	17.269724
officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the president ' s decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from aj .	60.364426
if communications work , his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order .	163.2565
for these centers , too , are on the gold circuit .	50.084663
they include the navy ' s atlantic command at norfolk , virginia , which is in contact with the polaris subs	26.7039
air force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases	103.2083
and sac , which controls long-range bombers and atlas missiles .	3.505325
let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- sac at omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of b-52 bombers could drop their aj .	89.49826
the key man almost certainly would be col . william w . wisman , sac ' s senior controller .	21.824139
he or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day .	36.729977
it is a quiet but impressive room -- 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high .	8.614179
movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information .	70.578384
and bill wisman , forty-three , a farmer ' s son from beallsville , ohio , is a quiet but impressive man .	30.713408
his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown .	89.02951
his movements and speech are precise , clear and quick .	42.169655
no question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .	10.513925
wisman , who has had the chief controller ' s job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons .	44.274055
at least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him .	109.32519
in front of him is a gold phone .	3.6981068
in emergencies the sac commander , gen . thomas power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above wisman and his staff .	57.18722
at general power ' s seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone .	30.771347
general power would participate in the decision making .	29.126997
wisman , below , would listen in and act .	83.15007
his consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every sac aircraft .	60.7788
he need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked alert .	230.31784
( there are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged .	64.6801
but wisman , too , does not know the go code .	177.88928
he must take it from `` the red box ' ' .	4.8980675
in point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to wisman ' s right .	54.095566
the box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ( `` it ' s real obnoxious ' ' ) .	24.279211
now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation ' s most guarded secrets .	25.799656
the codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various contingencies -- are contained in a sealed x-ray-proof `` unique device ' ' .	45.318913
they are supplied , a batch at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by wisman or his staff , at random intervals .	55.381233
but even the contents of wisman ' s box cannot start a war .	123.87376
they are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages .	7.6627135
what these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed .	142.63774
the pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by wisman ' s staff .	15.97319
in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal authenticator ' ' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing .	42.580215
i asked wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .	75.428085
`` i ' d wind up full of bullet holes ' ' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .	20.648512
now let us imagine a wing of b-52 ' s , on alert near their `` positive control ( or fail-safe ) points ' ' , the spots on the map , many miles from soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets .	61.023903
they , too , have fragments of the go code with them .	310.78992
as wisman put it , `` they have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie .	27.114834
once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it .	33.796345
unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing ' ' .	73.62008
why does wisman ' s ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? ?	12.252277
at any rate , three men out of a six-man b-52 crew are required to copy down wisman ' s go-to-war message .	70.654816
each must match wisman ' s `` pie ' ' with the fragment that he carries with him .	14.688419
all three must compare notes and agree to `` go ' ' .	12.530602
after that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released .	86.91677
unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done .	83.636086
suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended .	50.600365
they went as rigid as black statuary six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still .	72.906746
they all swung at the same instant in the same direction .	12.079807
they saw it before i did , even with my binoculars .	55.88206
it was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth .	20.203634
in the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no more .	79.899895
a white man would not have seen it .	6.775191
the aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos .	44.46089
watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land .	35.69924
at once the whole band set off at a lope .	10.718023
they went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow .	32.401817
i followed them in the jeep and now they did not care .	64.70296
the games were over , this was life .	14.905094
occasionally , for no reason that i could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot .	34.992603
sometimes i guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction .	53.191593
their gait is impossible to convey in words .	5.47542
it has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve .	37.32262
it is the gait of the human who must run to live arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful .	57.438427
it is a barely controlled skimming of the ground .	25.042875
finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall .	5.922686
for ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , raising their arms and , for the first time , shouting and capering .	21.090433
then the wind died and the rain squall held steady .	975.3941
suddenly one of them shouted , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground .	15.890922
he had found a depression with rain water in it .	55.45657
he bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground .	23.343422
with a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows .	18.687277
the other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle .	6.571387
in an instant he had sucked it dry .	9.414602
the aborigine lives on the cruelest land i have ever seen .	15.065608
which does not mean that it is ugly .	3.0384462
there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous .	9.428331
they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand .	64.71283
but much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable .	15.8859215
it is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly .	95.28981
the malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the australian charles bean .	12.060859
he tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer .	25.721943
they went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback ' ' country .	6.8275857
the countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps .	17.745504
nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men .	2.9078488
there might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps only -- there was not .	158.7707
there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise	448.95538
they lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them .	38.158524
even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died .	60.87501
he knows that the land is hard and pitiless .	2.0215588
he knows that the economy of life in the `` outback ' ' is awful .	10.509119
there is no room for error or waste .	6.949386
any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done .	26.603493
i do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but i suspect that it can .	21.650486
perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity .	82.797874
seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing .	17.250547
many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports .	10.070543
others are confined to vast reservations , and not only does the australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive , shunning camps , coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed .	75.210014
i persuaded an australian friend who had lived `` outback ' ' for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush .	40.800125
it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation , even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language .	50.287045
finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a land rover .	34.36626
we followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth .	42.11038
the rancher went a mile down this road and then , when he reached a big red boulder , swung off the road .	29.84098
at once he started to glance toward the instrument panel .	670.62537
it took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel there was a gimbaled compass welded to it , which rocked gently back and forth as the land rover bounced about .	67.75612
the rancher was navigating his way across the flatland .	6.828506
`` do you always navigate like this ' ' ? ?	1.7106415
`` damned right ' ' , he said .	6.312587
`` once i get out on the flat i do .	50.83707
some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks , a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there .	68.06011
but if you don ' t know the place like the palm of your hand , you ' d better use a compass and the speedometer .	50.436714
two miles northeast , then five miles southwest that sort of thing .	214.45505
i would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless .	23.887348
finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .	7.510631
they were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder a man , his lubra , and two children .	35.656788
the sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder .	35.60034
there was also a dog , a dingo dog .	20.764317
its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches .	36.485615
it lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully .	181.345
it struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog .	9.907616
`` the buggers love shade ' ' , the rancher said .	16.149494
`` i suppose because it saves them some loss of body water .	215.9341
they ' ll move around that rock all day , following the shade .	134.74231
during the hottest part of the day , of course , the sun comes straight down and there isn ' t any shade ' ' .	24.712172
we drove close to the boulder , stopped the land rover , and walked over toward the family .	48.748383
he gazed away from us as we approached .	51.539265
he was over six feet tall and very thin .	11.923125
every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving .	24.686419
he had long black hair and a wispy beard .	4.0703053
the ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut .	54.30065
there was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what .	62.271008
it was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets .	24.73765
a fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man ' s lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink .	13.780967
the australian and i both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine .	63.54238
she remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there	260.33313
like the man , she was entirely naked .	13.932981
her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her .	20.905188
there were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent .	31.41
there was also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy .	23.90788
there was also a boomerang , elaborately carved .	18.521147
everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless .	35.99275
the two children , both boys , wandered around the australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work .	64.95174
they squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a few inches from the ground .	26.891045
they had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at a time , and pinched them dead .	42.006283
the tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple .	32.241653
the odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines .	56.698452
the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .	112.53918
it was also subtly familiar , for it was the odor of the human body , but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed .	22.701437
one ' s impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant .	24.053345
but that is a cliche and a dishonest one .	137.42706
the smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it .	237.05795
their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin .	39.858013
they roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it .	111.2705
in spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and i realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared	57.037846
as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic .	12.078888
the boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes .	39.838943
`` that smell is something , eh , mate ' ' ? ?	29.350664
`` they swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other .	90.57082
at the corroborees , when they get to dancing and sweating , you ' ll see them rubbing up against a man who ' s supposed to have a specially good smell .	25.479301
idje , here ' ' , and he nodded at the man , `` is said to have great odor .	49.537502
the stink is all the same to me , but i really think they can make one another out blindfolded ' ' .	52.934746
`` here , idje , you fella like tabac ' ' ? ?	3.7262557
idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon .	6.1488914
the australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin i could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest .	136.17392
it was a fortunate time in which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in persian art .	46.427204
the architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through abbas ' s reign and those of his successors to enrich the city .	24.018536
travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .	26.040007
at the heart of all of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be `` as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a market as any in the universe ' ' .	69.19727
in time isfahan came to be known as `` half the world ' ' , isfahan nisf-i-jahan .	18.0448
in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of london , started to decline .	80.41117
isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old persia and sometimes of the east .	79.70175
they think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor .	145.10173
those who actually get there find that it isn ' t spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight .	39.689583
but even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which persia lies well preserved but indeed dead .	71.243515
everyone is ready to grant the persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present .	106.38784
it seems that for persia , and especially for this city , there are only two times the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present .	46.67671
the one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called `` historical monuments ' ' .	77.59955
however , just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared .	93.756134
the values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes .	56.00672
often , too , the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures are not simply `` historical monuments ' '	37.77224
the promenade , for example , continues to take place on the chahar bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city ' s principal street .	16.975557
it takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square .	19.058098
on fridays , the day when many persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it is true , stream into chehel sotun -- a pavilion and garden built by shah abbas 2 , in the seventeenth century -- but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former .	39.638798
and of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar .	47.136265
those three other great activities of the persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of persian domestic architecture long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches .	39.405773
but more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities .	58.136864
water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form -- these things are important to persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness .	36.614334
i should like , by the way , to make it clear that i am not using the word `` persians ' ' carelessly .	17.241589
i don ' t mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool .	75.328636
these things are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary .	32.473038
the men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer ' s night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses .	35.52696
a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor .	92.068115
not long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks .	50.490555
the air , he said , was just right	265.62997
i really didn ' t know what he meant .	7.731714
he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage .	22.399311
the natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the most ordinary of persians a great deal of attention .	47.002697
the line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from hafiz , the purity of spring water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion -- these things are noticed , judged , and valued .	33.89568
nowhere in isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so well as during the promenade at the khaju bridge .	27.123926
there has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city .	19.922417
for one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed	235.5867
for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in .	36.378975
it was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that shah abbas 2 , in about 1657 built , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge .	40.227547
from upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river	25.59787
from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion .	26.683138
the top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .	16.114025
at either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses .	49.128414
here , in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks -- sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between .	65.551216
below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge .	6.659204
these are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed .	39.505993
down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools .	28.037579
here , on the hottest day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults .	14.162442
on the downstream , or `` pavilion ' ' , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself .	87.07084
from the terraces -- eighteen in all -- broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river .	52.51047
out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge .	82.76542
on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge .	32.346275
the bridge itself rises up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera .	57.00807
crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege .	36.45555
all kinds come to walk in the promenade merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal	105.29279
a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket	7.0996
dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions	25.095388
the old kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines	1.3839794
students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns .	4.056369
families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar .	22.051102
below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river .	45.498306
above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of hafiz and saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance .	23.036386
here in an evening persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face .	67.80418
to a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for persians chase the golden calf as much as any people .	87.007
many of them , moreover , are beginning to complain about the scarcity of western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant .	19.409018
nonetheless , they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks .	68.49762
above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry .	138.9168
poetry in persian life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms -- all may stand .	75.364136
it contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life .	51.081154
and it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form .	62.34609
poetry for a persian is nothing less than truth and beauty .	32.098434
in most western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums .	29.93447
in persia , where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or , for that matter , hardly any books , the twins run free .	107.95861
it is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on london bridge the teddy boys of the east end will gather to sing marlowe , herrick , shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .	44.813194
that , at any rate , is what happens at the khaju bridge .	11.603014
boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .	13.335976
here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which persian music is divided .	94.46021
each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions .	98.62326
the singer simply matches the poem to a mode	156.24934
for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem `` they brought me news that spring is in the plains and ahmad ' s blood the crimson tulip stains	37.458496
go , tell his aged mother that her son fought with a thousand foes , and he was one ' ' .	31.54324
or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet `` know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth , that here , with dust upon his eyes , iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies .	88.46976
in this true lover ' s tomb interred a world of love lies sepulchred .	45.24013
these songs ( practically all persian music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves .	57.908607
yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque .	55.32868
die frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben jahr , the maestro quoted the flying dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times .	22.772873
the music director of the pittsburgh symphony orchestra , william steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life .	62.739506
when he added to his pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the london philharmonic orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting ' ' between the two cities .	22.96996
this schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious mr . steinberg .	33.973705
his london contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , `` i conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts ' ' ! !	46.684086
our meeting took place in may , 1961 , during one of the maestro ' s stop-overs in new york , before he left for europe .	31.427433
as we began to converse in the lounge of his fifth avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent .	57.18927
seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off .	60.545143
unfortunately , it was muzak , which automatically is piped into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured .	13.134552
as he talked about himself , time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled .	66.53909
did he come from a musical family ? ?	1.009347
yes though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family .	22.695326
in his native cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet .	19.113026
she even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values .	212.94063
when he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter a , instead of c , as in the scale .	43.145355
because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing czerny etudes , he composed his own studies .	22.05411
when he was eight he began violin lessons .	5.159655
soon he was playing in the cologne municipal orchestra , and during world war 1 , , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as well .	37.598606
steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .	132.03854
`` by observing the conductor ' ' , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , `` i learned how not to conduct ' ' .	19.420572
the musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the gymnasium .	32.106716
simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as well in the violin and piano .	16.162634
he became otto klemperer ' s personal assistant at the cologne opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor .	23.204521
wasn ' t this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ? ?	63.871468
had he always wished to be a conductor ? ?	27.162605
no , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such .	143.91463
however , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist .	18.976183
five years were spent with the cologne opera , after which he was called to prague by alexander von zemlinsky , teacher of arnold schonberg and erich korngold .	18.035084
in 1927 he succeeded zemlinsky as opera director of the german theater at prague .	10.349166
during his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the berlin state opera .	77.73906
two years later he became director of the frankfurt opera , where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the hitler regime .	63.673565
during these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in germany .	20.181892
he had presented the first german performances of puccini ' s manon lescaut and de falla ' s la vida breve .	3.9316368
the frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of berg ' s wozzek soon after the berlin premiere under erich kleiber , and the world premiere of schonberg ' s von heute auf morgen .	8.806824
at the outset of his career , steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a schonberg work every year .	45.237347
in frankfurt , too , he directed the museum and opera house concerts which , in addition to the standard repertoire , featured novelties like erdmann ' s piano concerto and mahler ' s sixth symphony .	16.535948
because of the political upheaval in germany in the 1930 ' s , steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the jewish community .	29.75018
through the frankfurt jewish kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with cellist emanuel feuermann .	8.005798
as more and more jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations steinberg united them into the frankfurt kulturbund orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other german cities .	54.061047
in 1936 he accepted the leadership of the berlin kulturbund .	41.29264
in the fall of that year the best musicians of the berlin and frankfurt kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of bronislaw hubermann and steinberg to become the palestine orchestra -- now known as the israel philharmonic orchestra -- with steinberg as founder-conductor .	31.66625
in 1938 , at the insistence of arturo toscanini , steinberg left germany for the united states , by way of switzerland .	37.41813
after he had spent the first three years in new york as associate conductor , at toscanini ' s invitation , of the nbc orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the united states and latin america .	26.804829
in 1945 he became conductor of the buffalo philharmonic .	4.1202974
seven years later he was asked to become director of the pittsburgh symphony .	13.372938
since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the san francisco opera , where he made his debut with a memorable performance of verdi ' s falstaff .	14.161439
in recent years he has traveled widely in europe , conducting in italy , france , austria , and switzerland .	20.2944
he returned to germany for the first time in 1953 , where he has since conducted in cologne , frankfurt , and berlin .	28.610216
where in europe was he going now ? ?	1.1753361
first of all , to italy for a short vacation -- forte dei marmi , a place he loves .	60.69189
since it is not far from viareggio , he will visit puccini ' s house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of la boheme , which he considers one of puccini ' s masterpieces .	20.676409
steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about italy `` rome is my second home .	102.35987
i consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year ' ' .	61.834953
he will conduct two concerts at the accademia di santa cecilia , as well as concerts in munich and cologne .	17.021885
`` then i return to the united states for engagements at the hollywood bowl and in philadelphia ' ' , he added .	38.62859
the forthcoming season in pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest .	45.23561
there will be premieres of new works , made possible through ford foundation commissions carlisle floyd ' s mystery , with phyllis curtin as soprano soloist .	46.28833
other world premieres will be gardner read ' s third symphony and burle marx ' s samba concertante .	10.073854
`` and next year we will do -- also a ford commission -- a piano concerto by elliott carter , with jacob lateiner as soloist .	35.792725
of course , i shall conduct mahler and bruckner works in the coming season , as usual .	90.483795
we ' ll play bruckner ' s fifth symphony in the original version , and mahler ' s seventh -- the least accessible , known , and played of mahler ' s works .	27.277382
my pittsburghers have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner ' ' .	5.2171416
he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour , especially mahler ' s first and fourth symphonies , and das lied von der erde , and bruckner ' s sixth -- which is rarely played -- and seventh .	33.725567
bruckner ' s eighth he refers to as `` my travel symphony ' ' .	23.572515
he recalled that in california after a critic had attacked him for `` still trying to sell bruckner to the americans ' ' , the public ' s response at the next concert was a standing ovation .	44.24141
`` now that bruno walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend dimitri mitropoulos is no longer with us , i am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of leonard bernstein -- who has this special affinity for and champions the works of bruckner and mahler ' ' .	47.525757
since he introduces so much modern music , i could not resist asking how he felt about it .	51.880905
`` there was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created .	108.70645
but i usually stick to the old phrase ' ich habe ein amt , aber keine meinung ( i hold an office , but i do not feel entitled to have an opinion ) .	15.217531
i consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today ' ' .	48.794792
with all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?	11.750512
he had just paid a brief visit to the frick collection to admire his favorite paintings by rembrandt and franz hals .	8.456482
he was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired claude lorrain , but reminisced with pleasure over a poussin exhibit he had been able to see in paris a year ago .	31.995232
and how did he feel about modern art ? ?	6.7892337
again steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments .	37.42131
`` as my wife puts it ' ' , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes , `` all you know is your music .	21.671804
but after all , you never learned anything else ' ' ! !	5.2784634
like his late colleague , mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular sir arthur conan doyle .	51.036526
he cited heine and stendhal as favorites in literature .	54.03374
but his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family -- his wife , daughter and son .	38.470177
at the moment he was excited about his son ' s having received the prix de rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an etruscan tomb .	34.107677
`` both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement ' ' .	20.923307
`` is the attitude of german youth comparable to that of `` the angry young men ' of england ' ' ? ?	26.590693
was the topic for a round-table discussion at the bayerische rundfunk in munich .	2.9361136
i was chairman , the only not youthful participant .	7.633781
since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , i added to my opening statement a sentence in which i claimed that german youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry .	81.84245
i was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly .	113.365326
`` it is easy for you to talk ' '	4.6595697
countered a twenty year old law student , `` you travel around the world .	49.265423
we would like to do that too ' ' .	1.4318194
`` but you want a job guaranteed when you return ' ' , i continued my attack .	43.53135
`` you must have some security ' ' , said a young clerk .	19.020363
when i mentioned that for my first long voyage i did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly .	47.640102
one girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .	10.915335
`` would you advise us to act the same way ? ?	21.955431
i think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck ' ' .	29.834578
others mentioned that i might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding .	110.22925
the debate needed no additional controversy and soon i could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears .	109.067924
though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .	44.08232
what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country .	9.083908
the ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children .	74.89355
no one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory .	169.47003
all expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .	59.246998
once again , as in the days of the founding fathers , america faces a stern test .	42.240826
that test , as president kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his state of the union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure ' ' .	45.222748
it is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril ' ' and of `` national opportunity ' ' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation .	46.04429
incapable of self-delusion , the founding fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that america would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty .	35.682224
seven founders -- george washington , benjamin franklin , john adams , thomas jefferson , alexander hamilton , james madison and john jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation .	32.98708
in certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way .	97.1174
as madison commented to jefferson in 1789 , `` we are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us .	43.383114
our successors will have an easier task ' ' .	1.3642985
they thought of themselves , to use jefferson ' s words , as `` the argonauts ' ' who had lived in `` the heroic age ' ' .	16.63147
accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity .	134.99113
their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved ' ' .	93.09059
strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the founding seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences .	33.969624
even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning american independence and founding a new nation .	75.637634
before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .	52.4721
certainly no other seven american statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years .	210.68391
eldest of the seven , benjamin franklin , a new englander transplanted to philadelphia , wrote the most dazzling success story in our history .	35.113224
the young printer ' s apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman .	13.870991
author of the albany plan of union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the revolution , he fought the colonists ' front-line battles in london , negotiated the treaty of alliance with france and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the federal convention .	30.90189
on a military mission for his native virginia the youthful george washington touched off the french and indian war , then guarded his colony ' s frontier as head of its militia .	77.26454
commanding the continental army for six long years of the revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory .	37.790604
retiring to his beloved mount vernon , he returned to preside over the federal convention , and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected president .	41.055157
during his two terms the constitution was tested and found workable , strong national policies were inaugurated , and the traditions and powers of the presidential office firmly fixed .	95.72158
john adams fashioned much of pre-revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of massachusetts , negotiated , with franklin and jay , the peace with britain and served as our first vice president and our second president .	63.52054
his political opponent and lifetime friend , thomas jefferson , achieved immortality through his authorship of the declaration of independence , but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the louisiana territory during his first term as president .	48.766262
during the greater part of jefferson ' s career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow virginian , james madison , eight years his junior .	71.02053
the active sponsor of jefferson ' s measure for religious liberty in virginia , madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the constitution and in securing its ratification in virginia , founded the first political party in american history , and , as jefferson ' s secretary of state and his successor in the presidency , guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with britain .	37.53818
if franklin was an authentic genius , then alexander hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy .	17.298504
his revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders .	49.19606
principal author of `` the federalist ' ' , he swung new york over from opposition to the constitution to ratification almost single-handedly .	76.45452
his collaboration with washington , begun when he was the general ' s aide during the revolution , was resumed when he entered the first cabinet as secretary of the treasury .	26.513067
his bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the constitution stand as durable contributions .	77.979935
less dazzling than hamilton , less eloquent than jefferson , john jay commands an equally high rank among the founding fathers .	57.3102
he served as president of the continental congress .	9.682441
he played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with great britain that ended the revolution , and directed america ' s foreign affairs throughout the confederation period .	36.74724
as first chief justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated john marshall .	309.89713
he ended his public career as a two-term governor of new york .	13.409539
these seven founders constituted an intellectual and social elite , the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed .	49.051914
their social status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with washington , jefferson and jay	89.71914
in others by business and professional acumen , as with franklin and adams , or , in hamilton ' s case , by an influential marriage .	65.04776
unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they commanded both prestige and influence before the revolution started .	103.60849
as different physically as the tall , angular jefferson was from the chubby , rotund adams , the seven were striking individualists .	42.64908
ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they were amazingly articulate , wrote their own copy , and were masters of phrasemaking .	25.060661
capable of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens .	15.50961
john adams dismissed john dickinson , who voted against the declaration of independence , as `` a certain great fortune and piddling genius ' ' .	13.862914
washington castigated his critic , general conway , as being capable of `` all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity ' ' .	17.801327
and hamilton , who felt it `` a religious duty ' ' to oppose aaron burr ' s political ambitions , would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint .	45.85986
the seven founders were completely dedicated to the public service .	19.62252
madison once remarked `` my life has been so much a public one ' ' , a comment which fits the careers of the other six .	69.42813
franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests .	31.120829
washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management .	180.24326
he served as commander in chief during the revolution without compensation .	83.592545
john adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , jeremiah gridley , to `` pursue the study of the law , rather than the gain of it ' ' .	15.288692
in taking account of seventeen years of law practice , adams concluded that `` no lawyer in america ever did so much business as i did ' ' and `` for so little profit ' ' .	70.42055
when the revolution broke out , he , along with jefferson and jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice .	99.25128
hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter washington ' s cabinet .	122.45616
while he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends .	60.07905
`` if you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars ' ' , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was secretary of the treasury .	38.558117
to support his large family hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service .	60.600254
talleyrand passed his new york law office one night on the way to a party .	52.622047
hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle .	30.012707
`` i have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country , but now is working all night in order to support his family ' ' , he reflected .	70.29964
all seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality .	23.013353
john adams asserted in the continental congress ' declaration of rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the british constitution and the common law , and jefferson appealed in the declaration of independence `` to the tribunal of the world ' ' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature ' s god ' ' .	19.396103
they fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating tory property in violation of the treaty of 1783 .	19.935688
this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between john jay and a tory refugee , peter van schaack .	29.899399
jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend van schaack .	40.918995
yet when , at war ' s end , the ex-tory made the first move to resume correspondence , jay wrote him from paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement	58.50944
`` as an independent american i considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that john jay never ceased to be the friend of peter van schaack ' ' .	37.809387
the latter in turn assured him that `` were i arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , i should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause ' ' .	67.96308
all seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation .	48.69332
`` we have now a national character to establish ' ' , washington wrote in 1783 .	46.73774
`` think continentally ' ' , hamilton counseled the young nation .	179.83212
this new force , love of country , super-imposed upon -- if not displacing -- affectionate ties to one ' s own state , was epitomized by washington .	34.388218
his first inaugural address speaks of `` my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love ' ' .	56.59764
all sought the fruition of that nationalism in a federal government with substantial powers .	76.58446
save jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the federal constitution .	9.615375
they supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable .	23.266378
historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the seventeen nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs . limited government , with hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and jefferson and madison upholding the latter position .	42.294582
the state ' s rights position was formulated by jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolves , but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better hamiltonians than jeffersonians .	90.19789
in purchasing louisiana , jefferson had to adopt hamilton ' s broad construction of the constitution , and so did madison in advocating the rechartering of hamilton ' s bank , which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception , and in adopting a hamiltonian protective tariff .	33.5354
indeed , the old jeffersonians were far more atune to the hamilton-oriented whigs than they were to the jacksonian democrats .	10.778293
when , in 1832 , the south carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which madison had advanced in his old virginia resolve , they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman .	69.03206
in his political testament , `` advice to my country ' ' , penned just before his death , madison expressed the wish `` that the union of the states be cherished and perpetuated .	43.157825
let the open enemy to it be regarded as a pandora with her box opened	127.95539
and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into paradise ' ' .	25.764214
nostalgic yankee readers of erskine caldwell are today informed by proud georgians that tobacco road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the dow-jones average than with the cotton crop .	42.468132
thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the south -- an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of southern writers .	42.8646
indeed , it seems that only in today ' s southern fiction does tobacco road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live -- but only as a weary , overexploited phantom .	24.4877
those writers known collectively as the `` southern school ' ' have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize	101.78162
according to many critics , in fact , the south has led the north in literature since the civil war , both quantitatively and qualitatively .	27.76998
such writers as william faulkner and robert penn warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance .	77.45703
it is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season ' s cotton and tobacco crops	33.867058
of the stereotyped negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields	35.616337
of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the south its progressive leaps of the past century .	30.729303
this is not to say that the south is no longer agrarian	25.28542
such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .	5.3319416
but the south is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly enough , is not reflected in its literature .	32.907864
in 1950 it had become 47 . 1% urban .	147.17348
in a mere half-century the south has more than tripled its urban status .	7.2405787
there is a new south emerging , a south losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche -- especially within recent decades .	34.467518
as the new south snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more and more homogeneous with the north -- a tendency which willard thorp terms `` yankeefication ' ' , as evidenced in such cities as charlotte , birmingham , and houston .	31.911636
it is said that , even at the present stage of southern urbanization , such a city as atlanta is not distinctly unlike columbus or trenton .	114.621544
undoubtedly even the old southern stalwart richmond has felt the new wind william styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for bankhead mcgruder , a civil war general , now renamed , in typical california fashion , `` buena vista terrace ' ' .	39.421906
the effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force .	23.863747
as for progress , the `` backward south ' ' can boast of baton rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126 , 000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25 , 000 .	32.95114
the field , then , is ripe for new southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the southern yankeefication the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems	52.96089
truman capote is still reveling in southern gothicism , exaggerating the old southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as -- or even more unreal than -- yesterday .	54.998745
william styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a southern writer and yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he publishes .	70.366005
even the great god faulkner , the south ' s one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters	129.20517
such are simply not within his bounded province .	3.2730753
where are the writers to treat these changes ? ?	16.009811
has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ? ?	19.465439
perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades .	88.31916
lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as confederate money .	52.23646
an example of the changes which have crept over the southern region may be seen in the southern negro ' s quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865 .	36.11355
today the negro must discover his role in an industrialized south , which indicates that the racial aspect of the southern dilemma hasn ' t changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint .	48.25335
the negro faces as much , if not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one .	123.05532
this represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .	28.463621
but there have been abrupt changes as well the sit-ins , the picket lines , the bus strikes -- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago .	27.698956
today ' s evidence , such as the fact that only three southern states ( south carolina , alabama and mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many of yesterday ' s southerners into speechlessness .	78.36948
other examples of gradual changes that have affected the negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the buses	127.1064
his requesting , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the supreme court decision of 1954 .	96.70852
then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it	50.30111
only historical evolution will determine which ) an abrupt change .	3.723007
since 1954 the negro ' s desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion .	18.257708
he has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws .	42.637295
this bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the southern way of existence .	19.887783
a new order is thrusting itself into being .	104.47076
a new south is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man .	31.014812
the modern negro has not made a decisive debut into southern fiction .	64.55981
it is clear that , while most writers enjoy picturing the negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters `` yassuhs ' ' and `` sho ' nufs ' ' with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in old south terms , `` massuh ' ' ) , this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as caldwell ' s lester .	27.610762
while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through the rural south , such men appear to be a vanishing breed .	58.702686
writers openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man	56.255344
but they obviously mean by this , not a negro personality , but a negro type .	83.77011
presenting an individualized negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could tackle	82.56983
and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare .	43.7789
just as the negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature .	48.27005
the book concerned with the negro ' s role in an urban society is rare indeed	97.470825
recently only keith wheeler ' s novel , peaceable lane , has openly faced the problem .	41.597267
all but the most rabid of confederate flag wavers admit that the old southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .	27.294455
many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious old south ' ' imagery , creating such lasting impressions as margaret mitchell ' s `` tara ' ' plantation .	24.658289
modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .	40.067207
perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing	24.843157
but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .	55.046524
as john t . westbrook says in his article , `` twilight of southern regionalism ' ' ( southwest review , winter 1957 ) `` the miasmal mausoleum where an old south , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with ' ' .	48.050346
westbrook further bemoans the southern writers ' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting yankees `` our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence ( of urbanization ) presented to his senses .	43.29774
he is too deeply steeped in william faulkner and robert penn warren .	16.921616
the fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hogs and night riders .	39.74232
on this trip to the south he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight ' ' .	17.4577
obviously , such a northern tourist ' s purpose is somewhat akin to a child ' s experience with disneyland he wants to see a world of make-believe .	32.276196
in the meantime , while the south has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious yankee , southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region ' s progress .	70.66068
willard thorp , in his new book , american writing in the twentieth century , observes , quite validly it seems `` certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched .	33.460194
no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what herrick , dreiser , and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did for new york .	27.943176
there are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south ' ' .	66.03202
not a single southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material .	177.71465
faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard .	39.487217
faulkner culminates the southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done .	65.93099
he has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably .	241.2631
he treats it with a mythological , universal application .	395.64935
as his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite keenly , as can be proven by a quick recalling of his sartoris and snopes families .	50.111732
even two decades ago in go down , moses faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the south might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil .	68.538
yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .	57.08669
faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of yoknapatawpha county , the gradual changes which seep into the south , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the old way .	31.769533
thus faulkner reminds us , and wisely , that the `` new ' ' south has gradually evolved out of the old south , and consequently its agrarian roots persist .	38.410557
yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself the problems with which a new south must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization .	65.257866
with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil .	82.774734
the thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas .	69.769394
another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre .	31.717148
most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting .	32.063976
but robert rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them .	36.694008
he has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for mr . cunningham ' s summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity .	40.26304
for mr . taylor ' s images and reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl ' s cape lined with grass .	30.95966
mr . nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .	10.316948
in fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound .	62.776165
to raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , mr . nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit .	32.19366
he began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be .	61.303772
he went on to use objects -- hoops , poles , capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them .	35.57706
the depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure .	34.40716
in each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .	29.063074
the dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol , begins to feel that it is part of herself .	47.9162
or , clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a `` finial ' ' .	18.574137
as the dancer is depersonalized , his accouterments are animized , and the combined elements give birth to a new being .	58.14942
from this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit .	65.48405
thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition .	44.480625
but , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ? ?	36.30636
some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work .	55.46689
others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician .	77.91188
an approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of charles olson ' s statement of the process of projective verse `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception ' ' .	67.234764
the creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience .	68.341545
he disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax , traditional metre .	43.56876
the unit of form is determined subjectively `` the heart , by the way of the breath , to the line ' ' .	21.943916
the test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters .	42.744896
an earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious .	39.044014
the resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order .	22.4015
the contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies .	45.7425
he is still concerned , however , with a personal event .	98.19521
he accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation .	17.91022
the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience .	30.384651
some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth .	43.68034
rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world .	79.43806
but in this approach it is the artist ' s ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work .	39.624115
others look to more objective devices of order .	3.87608
the musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that , once set in motion , determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities .	26.873497
the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) .	112.99802
he may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .	28.594858
but he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired .	123.94112
musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .	95.62705
again , the composer must select his own materials .	57.99803
but a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the i ching , the chinese book of changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials .	60.978207
avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turned to similar approaches .	65.26453
some let dances take their form from the experience of creation .	41.10074
according to katherine litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance ' ' .	41.06768
the process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it .	29.511505
the sequence may involve a sharp contrast for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap	28.675398
or it may involve more subtle distinctions the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head .	54.34849
even the least alteration will change the quality .	98.71195
an exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance .	55.02857
the approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for miss litz , or spontaneous , as it is for merle marsicano .	18.189585
she , too , is concerned with `` the becoming , the process of realization ' ' , but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns .	28.61843
the design is determined emotionally `` i must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me ' ' .	30.852617
looking back , miss marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson pollock .	38.560307
at one time she felt impelled to make dances that `` moved all over the stage ' ' , much as pollock ' s paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas .	45.656372
but her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself .	121.63821
midi garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement .	40.207706
it may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground .	32.37526
this became a dance called prelude to flight .	5.6922126
a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus .	142.58041
alwin nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion .	28.24174
he seeks to make his dancers more `` godlike ' ' by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape , light , color , and sound .	14.977402
if his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from mars , this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities .	36.718746
it is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered .	48.26855
in his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the `` first revealed stroke of its existence ' ' , states the theme from which all else must follow .	95.58042
the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve .	95.21791
it may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions .	119.61798
it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs .	55.127033
unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their `` motional content ' ' .	15.43646
movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .	164.06422
though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , merce cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim .	36.67614
he rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect .	47.7221
he bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything .	61.20531
an order can be chanced rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is `` free and discovered rather than bound and remembered ' ' .	72.44477
thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well .	39.65948
chance , he finds , enables him to create `` a world beyond imagination ' ' .	54.00822
he cites with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaimed after a concert `` why , it ' s extremely interesting .	24.351393
but i would never have thought of it myself ' ' .	12.81239
the sequence of movements in a cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life .	36.31143
at one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly	2.2555368
nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella .	25.799564
they look straight at the audience , not at each other .	122.98768
he lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .	47.59857
if one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon .	52.25537
their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all .	28.645538
the sequence is determined by chance , and mr . cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices .	99.75146
he may take slips of paper from a grab bag .	28.957811
the answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed .	46.312706
the other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance .	50.644913
the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance .	35.12717
the `` approximate ' ' is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not inviolable .	44.885788
if a work is divided into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance .	27.928268
and any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether .	80.95275
mr . cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method	91.671135
he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can .	106.797714
however , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute .	264.63437
he must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other .	17.734446
he must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .	155.9975
the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the founding fathers .	158.58215
the truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of webster and calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of lincoln and lee .	28.624529
the people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their union .	97.499466
repeated efforts -- beginning with the missouri compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as clay and douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action .	54.28527
even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century .	32.77403
nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .	108.36529
the present issue in atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the american one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by civil war .	52.656628
and so i would only touch upon it now ( much as i have long wanted to write a book about it ) .	72.01906
i think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject .	88.62911
the difference came down to this the southern states insisted that the united states was , in last analysis , what its name implied -- a union of states .	52.01122
to their leaders the constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from it .	60.98571
this right of the state , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the union government .	24.467518
the champions of the union maintained that the constitution had formed , fundamentally , the united people of america , that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states , and that therefore the states had no right to secede , though the citizens could .	67.71975
writing to speed on august 24 , 1855 , lincoln made the latter point clear .	251.97125
in homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede .	64.667
we began by declaring that all men are created equal .	10.191417
we now practically read it , all men are created equal except negroes .	32.3474
when the know-nothings get control , it will read , all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics .	63.087196
when it comes to this , i shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to russia , for instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy ' ' ( his emphasis )	46.184258
when the southern states exercised their `` right to secede ' ' , they formed what they officially styled `` the confederate states of america ' ' .	14.591961
dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the articles of confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy .	38.360653
the fact is that the southern confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the federal constitution did .	69.28043
the confederate constitution copied much of the federal constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance .	16.198988
it operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the federal constitution .	85.80222
it made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches .	50.69528
the difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861	20.199106
many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the constitution of the southern confederacy and the federal constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede .	42.33559
but though each of its members had asserted this right against the union , the final constitution which the confederacy signed on march 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede .	76.34801
its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their constitution .	50.03414
their president , jefferson davis , interpreted their constitution to mean that it `` admits of no coerced association ' ' , but this remained so doubtful that `` there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the constitution ' ' .	38.792233
the constitution of the southern `` confederation ' ' differed from that of the federal union only in two important respects it openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the federal constitution .	64.41089
they recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the declaration of 1776 that `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .	40.310043
' ' the other important difference between the two constitutions was that the president of the confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term .	70.11972
these are not , however , differences in federal structure .	72.977425
the only important differences from that standpoint , between the two constitutions , lies in their preambles .	15.6826935
the one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .	101.57095
here are the two preambles federal constitution , 1789	541.71405
`` we the people of the united states , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america ' ' .	29.53309
`` we the people of the confederate states , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of almighty god -- do ordain and establish this constitution for the confederate states of america ' ' .	33.860874
one is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the nineteenth century was fought .	24.226044
but though the southern states , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states .	31.720602
if the union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union .	93.72677
lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the union a vital one whether it was a union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to `` anarchy or despotism ' ' .	57.224426
much as he abhorred slavery , lincoln was always willing to concede to each `` slave state ' ' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it .	53.361187
though his election was interpreted by many southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union , lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the constitution gave the states .	66.71106
after the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action even in the border states that stayed with the union .	67.470085
he issued his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the union .	144.19832
in his message of december 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which i would call the lincoln law of liberty-and-union `` in giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free ' ' .	43.081585
what lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the union .	153.52751
he fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people ' ' .	25.446014
the truth on each side won in the civil war	5.159238
the fact that the americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater .	56.36742
out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the south as in the north , as america ' s true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom ' ' , as lincoln promised .	45.991524
but before this came about , 214 , 938 americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .	56.24153
on their decisive battlefield lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fought here ' ' .	44.60906
he understood that both sides were at fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his second inaugural .	26.613567
to my knowledge , lincoln remains the only head of state and commander-in-chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth .	126.82446
so great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend .	81.074356
it is much less difficult now than in lincoln ' s day to see that on both sides sovereign americans had given their lives in the civil war to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the states and to their union .	45.572838
they differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth that individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves .	62.967525
the 140 , 414 americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion ' ' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the united states from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people .	40.812218
but the fact that 70 , 524 other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served liberty-and-union in other essential ways .	52.663105
its appeal from ballots to bullets at fort sumter ended by costing the southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man .	67.35786
the very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure .	108.41381
there was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another .	104.11533
there was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet .	65.42259
yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for .	60.381382
the lives so many of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all americans against freedom ' s other foe .	67.37122
as cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural ' ' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world .	37.206356
the useful suggestion of professor david hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments .	71.94108
will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ?	25.849726
the answer is , of course , yes .	3.5027528
for the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .	145.58221
social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of archimedes .	51.226814
but it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides .	43.13211
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons	44.484272
we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down	98.0354
at what stage are social sciences then ? ?	1.0500429
is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of newton ? ?	46.029778
there is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in copernicus and in freud .	87.63427
and it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .	85.15785
political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man .	33.22438
consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .	37.22103
most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .	50.66235
the most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .	74.03679
just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .	40.97623
we are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .	43.32837
in fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other .	240.02975
i want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .	74.657326
there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .	105.13441
lucretius has remarked `` the reason why all mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of god ' ' .	41.139385
it is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .	13.499454
we get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was .	95.763084
we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets .	64.62816
the bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage .	13.3805
we are worried about what people may do with them -- that some crazy fool may `` push the button ' ' .	37.42974
i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly .	62.72784
they are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .	20.734755
they include both individual fears and collective ones .	2.0803287
they arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .	51.168053
often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .	84.01581
yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .	73.21681
to say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .	166.04057
but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .	18.380117
the frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .	75.90601
it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice .	42.550297
this and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then , more firmly , with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions .	43.91511
this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .	37.26694
in fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .	31.38113
there is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .	22.220907
solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .	12.214549
our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing .	172.7355
this almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .	151.4362
we , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing .	59.01002
and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave .	50.287918
what elements of our behavior are decisive ? ?	1.0149806
our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? ?	35.562466
we have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .	102.573395
i think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city .	35.293213
if an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .	39.108624
with the group of boys it is different .	4.7718487
he does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side .	34.716976
when confronted with a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others .	68.78779
i believe that what i do has some effect on his actions and i have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics .	78.308586
i am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose .	170.37183
our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise .	43.45341
we are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements .	64.24927
our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them .	78.378555
we use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as `` trust ' ' , `` cheat ' ' , and `` get tough ' ' .	18.723461
we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles .	23.017742
we perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .	92.85253
small wonder , then , that we fear .	29.05422
the achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .	44.885117
what additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ? ?	72.75097
in the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics .	36.26264
in the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio- and physiological chemistry .	22.461855
the major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment .	64.5592
in addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .	72.142586
even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated .	57.0945
apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .	25.582708
how and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study .	83.1297
in some areas , the progress is slower than in others .	26.771612
in agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster .	47.406387
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory .	44.199944
there are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .	197.39903
much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .	28.409912
the persistent horror of having a malformed child has , i believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it .	83.791725
in fact , the recent warnings about the use of x-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .	60.353603
in fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty .	77.37412
perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .	77.2146
the situation with regard to our attitude and `` control ' ' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people .	63.016453
the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear i have tried to describe .	31.14119
nothing like godot , he arrived before the hour .	62.58067
his letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday , and i came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve .	35.54908
my wish to meet samuel beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .	40.45587
american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .	4.367649
even so astute a commentator as harold clurman of the nation has said that `` waiting for godot ' ' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair ' ' .	16.021858
but to me beckett ' s writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .	45.619606
could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? ?	61.34758
is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? ?	42.255795
or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? ?	50.748596
i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself .	52.857037
my curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation i had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near paris .	67.767586
when beckett ' s name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that beckett `` hates life ' ' .	35.16198
that , i thought , is at least one thing i can find out when we meet .	42.89255
the features of his face are distinct , but not fine .	32.530502
they look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .	6.3121977
unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .	108.05991
for he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another .	36.452145
his light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking .	50.469097
he seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face .	82.06011
the mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .	4.142801
the voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage .	33.385994
the irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the french .	32.491978
his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .	110.025925
he wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie .	48.153698
we walked down the rue de l ' arcade , thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church .	25.494589
the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering .	12.593574
for one thing , the world that beckett sees is already shattered .	48.290226
his talk turns to what he calls `` the mess ' ' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion ' ' .	18.041328
i reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation .	45.984016
what appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words .	85.522835
we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion .	25.009748
it is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in .	98.060646
the only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess .	34.574554
it is not a mess you can make sense of ' ' .	25.927572
i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but beckett did not take to the word truth .	35.119946
`` what is more true than anything else ? ?	4.884222
to swim is true , and to sink is true .	76.13446
one is not more true than the other .	349.75406
one cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess .	36.495552
when heidegger and sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , i don ' t know , but their language is too philosophical for me .	61.82991
one can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess ' ' .	32.686913
then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .	74.96714
until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things .	22.305368
it realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form .	94.86854
`` how could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be ' ' ? ?	55.779648
but now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invades our experience at every moment .	69.800705
it is there and it must be allowed in ' ' .	34.430897
i granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously .	122.01702
how , i asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ?	29.253004
would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ?	28.106716
if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .	158.12169
beckett ' s own work is an example .	6.6495814
plays more highly formalized than `` waiting for godot ' ' , `` endgame ' ' , and `` krapp ' s last tape ' ' would be hard to find .	10.697843
`` what i am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art .	30.946798
it only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else .	43.59228
the latter is not reduced to the former .	47.092342
that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates .	55.6651
to find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now ' ' .	32.142353
yet , i responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? ?	47.874245
is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way ? ?	50.94542
what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? ?	88.75272
`` not this ' ' , he said , and gestured toward the madeleine .	21.515324
the classical lines of the church which napoleon thought of as a temple of glory , dominated all the scene where we sat .	83.15289
the boulevard de la madeleine , the boulevard malesherbes , and the rue royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the age of reason .	18.92167
this does not allow the mystery to invade us .	13.908375
there is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer ' ' .	27.670078
i asked about the battle between life and death in his plays .	26.45519
didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide	328.3903
hamm ' s world is death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside .	164.23462
is this life-death question a part of the chaos ? ?	58.683147
if life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability .	25.275078
if there were only darkness , all would be clear .	31.53498
it is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable .	110.17345
take augustine ' s doctrine of grace given and grace withheld have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ? ?	61.5775
two thieves are crucified with christ , one saved and the other damned .	19.909004
how can we make sense of this division ? ?	4.932742
in classical drama , such problems do not arise .	30.54207
the destiny of racine ' s phedre is sealed from the beginning she will proceed into the dark .	27.400229
as she goes , she herself will be illuminated .	89.05732
at the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark .	37.0412
within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither greek nor jansenist there is not such clarity .	32.860863
the question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation .	138.69882
but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable .	49.026802
the key word in my plays is ' perhaps ' ' ' .	26.127254
given a theological lead , i asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays .	80.92164
`` well , really there is none at all .	13.776791
he knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel .	6.4046397
the family was protestant , but for me it was only irksome and i let it go .	34.896015
my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died .	145.004
at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie .	60.274055
irish catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper .	38.295105
when you pass a church on an irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross .	39.437134
one day the dogs of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs ' ' .	51.999104
but do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ? ?	122.34784
`` yes , for they deal with distress .	67.628426
some people object to this in my writing .	3.241963
at a party an english intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why i write always about distress .	137.02496
as if it were perverse to do so ! !	65.22178
he wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood .	104.58295
i told him no , that i had had a very happy childhood .	86.42242
then he thought me more perverse than ever .	12.974753
i left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi .	31.587482
on the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees .	90.09688
one does not have to look for distress .	3.097604
it is screaming at you even in the taxis of london ' ' .	21.791819
lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming at us .	27.415743
the personal quality of samuel beckett is similar to qualities i had found in the plays .	69.809
he says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .	104.98281
`` perhaps ' ' stands in place of commitment .	31.942488
at the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly .	207.2835
if there were only the mess , all would be clear	36.397964
as a christian , i know i do not stand where beckett stands , but i do see much of what he sees .	33.587532
as a writer on the theater , i have paid close attention to the plays .	84.28501
harold clurman is right to say that `` waiting for godot ' ' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of europe ' s present politics , ethic , and common way of life ' ' .	31.91245
yet it is not only europe the play refers to .	81.98299
`` waiting for godot ' ' sells even better in america than in france .	48.69602
the consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to europe than to america , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature ' ' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture .	32.743046
america is now joining europe in this `` mature ' ' phase of development .	41.722496
whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of asia and africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .	37.493904
even hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in the sun also rises and a farewell to arms never maintained that sex was all .	106.34109
hemingway ' s fiction is supported by a `` moral ' ' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension .	34.1853
and d . h . lawrence , in fantasia of the unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .	10.466574
though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex .	52.138897
`` all is not sex ' ' , declared lawrence .	270.40652
man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .	31.763695
the creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self .	20.427074
but for the beat generation all is sex .	4.3022556
nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex .	89.62883
for the beatnik , like the hipster , is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct .	32.27289
he has elevated sex -- not eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex -- to the rank of the godhead	21.49503
it is astarte , ishtar , venus , yahwe , dionysus , christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe .	10.810357
jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse .	12.024978
lawrence lipton , in the holy barbarians , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure	67.03283
it is a mystique , and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse .	25.90326
the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place .	66.21063
the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire .	70.874886
for this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy .	21.575804
the beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates .	73.105774
it is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy .	33.73844
they withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety .	8.328398
unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of `` necking ' ' and `` petting ' ' .	7.4270983
if they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo	19.049257
as lipton , the prophet of the beat generation , declares `` in the sexual act , the beat are filled with mana , the divine power .	28.251173
this is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat ' ' .	21.968975
this is the holy grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond .	33.357853
if wilhelm reich is the moses who has led them out of the egypt of sexual slavery , dylan thomas is the poet who offers them the dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz .	46.44401
in addition , they have been converted to zen buddhism , with its glorification of all that is `` natural ' ' and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing .	31.355808
thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to `` religious ' ' metaphors they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion .	47.119743
what they are after is the beatific vision .	8.826872
and zen buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release .	43.545776
the style of life chosen by the beat generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own , is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience .	34.34436
jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect .	150.56662
jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm	7.076631
indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value .	48.891678
that is why , the argument runs , the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it .	34.930687
instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction .	32.05982
thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being .	154.5921
jazz , like sex , is a mystique .	5.1415615
it is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man .	55.34103
the mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living .	34.833225
those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination .	84.601105
righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats	203.50014
let them learn to `` swing ' ' freely , to let go , to become authentically themselves , and then perhaps civilization will be saved .	122.28787
the beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present .	36.863625
if he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil .	55.44991
he will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth .	63.473186
that is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians	26.837276
they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in .	26.14896
apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge .	31.006962
their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation .	8.417751
the mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life	47.899067
they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious .	17.699652
with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm .	16.460121
their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible .	10.294749
their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent .	25.445038
and the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive , even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing , painting , music .	42.970528
when they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation .	13.812001
it is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed .	29.54829
what they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the muse .	49.356728
monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability .	42.758266
one girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion .	33.22385
if it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? ?	85.248856
`` most often ' ' , she says , `` it ' s the monogamous relationship that is dishonest ' ' .	6.218707
this girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life .	30.987488
she finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous .	5.663396
this confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences .	102.922714
in the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme .	47.025093
hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex	54.879604
some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality .	29.458775
one beat poet composes a poem , `` lines on a tijuana john ' ' , which contains a few happy hints for survival .	66.284294
the new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity .	76.35274
the professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation .	36.605404
who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ?	10.153519
nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society .	18.261646
they embrace independent poverty , usually with a `` shack-up ' ' partner who will help support them .	27.874117
they are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony .	6.091486
their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void .	39.845974
they feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police .	14.18768
this is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these `` religious ' ' heights .	83.920074
one beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up .	56.691826
what obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk ? ?	26.290037
sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth .	25.25538
everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism .	108.468056
in his chapter on `` the loveways of the beat generation ' ' , lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details .	9.104741
no one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in west venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group .	54.66914
the women who come to west venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move .	51.848408
others who are attracted to this mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals , heroin addicts , and smalltime hoodlums .	10.755325
those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks .	18.43519
since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated .	16.02598
part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .	21.803398
as lipton puts it `` the eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms .	43.882153
the magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm ' ' .	48.178734
under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being .	47.70393
carried high on this `` charge ' ' , he composes `` magical ' ' poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words .	19.546144
if he thus achieves a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work -- allen ginsberg ' s `` howl ' ' is a striking example of this tendency -- that is disoriented , dionysian but without depth and without apollonian control .	39.25604
for drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity .	9.105241
how is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses .	25.002964
if love reflects the nature of man , as ortega y gasset believes , if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love , then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre .	30.764475
there were fences in the old days when we were children .	79.90477
across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles .	37.476242
alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one ' s head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them .	45.24771
side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses	1.7151163
front fences were covered with virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle .	5.46592
square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage	65.72627
they were topped by steeples complete in every detail high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable .	11.159583
on these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang .	11.563021
the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree .	34.154514
the primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us .	53.853416
from high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible .	46.784702
one looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower .	37.097126
every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit trees .	55.80838
in the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub , snowball , rose-of-sharon and balm-of-gilead .	8.092293
from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea a neighbor ' s gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .	34.042324
time is a queer thing and memory a queerer	2.893013
the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all .	75.10773
from maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large .	172.15004
in a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water	41.66621
the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it .	28.648972
and yet -- a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one ' s being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end .	75.61643
the part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` it could have been like that for only a little while ' '	81.378204
but true memory does not count nor add it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time .	129.28343
once , then -- for how many years or how few does not matter -- my world was bound round by fences , when i was too small to reach the apple tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up .	104.049324
that world was in scale with my own smallness .	20.45683
i have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that i could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of november	50.595623
ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown-edged holes	29.91542
hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it .	69.43839
i think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren .	46.960938
my great-grandmother , i have been told , made her garden her great pride	268.76727
she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar	13.882858
she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house .	21.777384
these my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending .	76.03613
three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink	36.7539
the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them	26.749249
i have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .	42.5275
other flowers we might gather as we pleased myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs	8.767076
the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach	66.44084
hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside down , make pink-petticoated ladies	864.47766
and the little , dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere .	60.53114
more potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .	96.31468
flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead .	124.90003
pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite	7.5312285
seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch	64.69722
red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them	62.78284
morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag	56.706753
bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made `` gloves ' ' on the ends of ten waggling fingers .	16.694687
fuzzy caterpillars , snails with their sensitive horns , struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to `` spit tobacco , spit ' ' .	18.185617
dead fledgling birds , their squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags .	26.02555
and the cast shell of a locust , straw-colored and transparent , weighing nothing , fragile but entire , with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back .	37.0601
every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade .	22.096457
we collected `` lucky stones ' ' -- all the creamy translucent pebbles , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway .	22.23125
when these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated .	117.74068
we showed them to each other and said `` would you have guessed ' ' ? ?	19.362558
squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by .	74.56621
thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness	21.814379
even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a vine-embowered gate-post was the sleeping beauty ' s enchanted castle , or when rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside .	32.891834
we enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school .	131.58636
in the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone	96.35469
our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch .	21.132547
they never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and `` don ' t go outside the gate ' ' was a command so impossible of misinterpretation .	66.478615
we were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street .	96.81386
we were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes .	23.181927
the street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an august afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .	48.872154
every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it .	120.91356
a hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves .	53.5252
a wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again .	56.19017
if a child watched its progress he whispered , `` hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away ' ' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses ' feet returned no more .	62.77781
when the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster ' s cart might turn the corner .	38.22199
the horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees .	38.91311
sleepily , as if half-reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice `` rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today ' ' ! !	35.403553
the lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee .	4.530018
no one seemed to hear him , no one heeded .	7.78602
the horse plodded on , and he repeated his call .	50.768566
it became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness .	9.1634245
after his passage , the street was empty again .	346.8582
the sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down	563.18524
the trees ' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn .	39.23688
at four-o ' clock , or four-thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day	25.030338
he tossed a paper toward every front door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing .	68.37296
the streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer	69.18961
they were like this fifty-odd years ago , and yesterday .	241.02943
but the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides .	57.813335
the curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees .	36.45552
opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .	19.585503
the street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center	20.379019
it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones .	29.26268
it had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since .	130.50043
the hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses .	21.227736
cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys ' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide .	27.27743
it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for mann ' s work .	43.046124
the wife , amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous ' ' and `` indolent ' ' , possibly `` a mischief maker ' ' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning ' ' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` birdlike brain ' ' .	17.991442
lautner , for his part , `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves ' ' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs ' ' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order ' ' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled `` they will be destroyed ' ' .	33.223694
the trick these two play upon jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well .	154.21236
his appearance as lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience	40.069088
it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation .	28.82633
at the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like jacoby ' s , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life .	47.678486
the music which lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal ' ' .	27.663067
but it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice ' ' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art ' ' .	24.793783
and this occurs now , at the refrain of jacoby ' s song -- at the point , in fact , of the name `` lizzy ' ' --	19.984304
a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius ' ' .	4.7538824
`` a miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude ' ' .	68.81934
it is this modulation which reveals to jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife ' s infidelity .	26.80373
by the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience	118.38099
in the work of every artist , i suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about	57.35216
not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment .	36.82267
the horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby	52.936954
the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering ' ' )	38.240334
the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant -- all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself	74.83404
beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of mann ' s work .	23.392033
when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , i come up with the following ideas , which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .	89.08858
love is the crucial dilemma of experience for mann ' s heroes .	7.575461
the dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .	38.07835
the release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible	837.68475
this prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art	305.65045
it is particularly the artist ( tonio kroger , aschenbach , leverkuhn ) who suffers from it .	10.045247
the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough ' ' in the realm of art .	13.117325
again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child .	70.26307
finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of mann ' s stories .	23.440142
we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates .	59.18361
for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody .	29.44515
professionally a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised -- that is , paradoxically , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .	55.468395
that this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art	124.53061
that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in mann ' s stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between jacoby and lautner .	47.36035
it appears that the dominant tendency of mann ' s early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic .	57.874237
in a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same .	61.920105
something of this can be learned from `` the way to the churchyard ' ' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .	42.104153
there is no more `` plot ' ' than that	122.920494
only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give .	241.10509
the artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness .	66.441414
the first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent `` the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end	26.974861
that is to say , to the churchyard ' ' .	4.73507
and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction .	32.739388
the highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death .	18.342157
but that is too simple , and won ' t hold up .	18.990072
as the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end .	23.62231
but the highroad , according to the description of its traffic , belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life a suffering form , an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death .	44.983368
thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers `` marched in their own dust and sang ' ' , while on the footpath one man walks alone .	37.409863
this man ' s isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent .	14.368651
he is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth	78.73411
also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account .	120.97065
his name is praisegod piepsam , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author ' s repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in `` death in venice ' ' , for example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp .	26.144272
this strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad .	103.50523
the cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` life ' ' -- that and a license number , which piepsam uses in addressing him .	92.1426
`` life ' ' points out that `` everybody uses this path ' ' , and starts to ride on .	97.07689
piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` life ' ' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather .	74.5803
that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god imprecates doom on life -- not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well `` all you light-headed breed ' ' .	29.341236
this passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .	20.780062
then an ambulance comes along , and they drive praisegod piepsam away .	45.83497
this is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .	42.79703
the season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect .	63.18989
piepsam ' s fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because god will not stop him	46.8545
as piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments `` his justice is not of this world ' ' .	54.64084
life is further characterized , in antithesis to piepsam , as animal the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle a dog in a wagon is `` admirable ' ' , `` a pleasure to contemplate ' '	59.583603
another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid of interest ' ' .	16.26102
piepsam calls the cyclist `` cur ' ' and `` puppy ' ' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face .	41.696266
the ambulance is drawn by two `` charming ' ' little horses .	17.669197
piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense .	34.234158
his religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness	41.851276
his unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings	59.066944
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe praisegod piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated ' ' .	41.380848
the cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic life , `` blithe and carefree ' ' .	11.697067
`` he made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth ' ' .	36.299683
he is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard ' ' .	6.353139
but he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than life considered as a cyclist .	72.73313
and if i have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in mann ' s writing the crude sketch of piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for instance , naphta and leverkuhn .	50.61575
in method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism ' ' , anticipates a kind of musical composition , as well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as leverkuhn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic ' ' .	26.323557
it resembles , too , pictures such as durer and bruegel did , in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for example , or a deadly sin .	37.522358
`` gladius dei ' ' ( 1902 ) resembles `` the way to the churchyard ' ' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` life ' ' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict .	27.11205
the monk savonarola , brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background of munich at the turn of the century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of m . bluthenzweig	25.754898
in particular against a madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according to gossip , upon the painter ' s mistress .	24.864021
hieronymus , like piepsam , makes his protest quite in vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating	22.765003
he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter .	27.019218
on the street outside , hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in florence , and prophetically he issues his curse `` gladius dei super terram cito et velociter ' ' .	22.404867
the `` reality ' ' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world .	60.172714
their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason .	25.72417
these polar concerns ( imitation vs . formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time .	30.069527
the breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes .	30.380913
thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers .	17.1251
the image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery .	48.271324
all such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality ' ' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved .	78.48439
the person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems .	37.735584
whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together .	30.293886
without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being .	40.29198
and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .	121.4077
for better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation ' ' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism .	16.298447
a broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist ' s creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises .	36.38313
on the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .	39.59494
we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .	8.3479395
accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which i shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which i shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) .	43.152164
the word `` mimesis ' ' ( `` imitation ' ' ) is usually associated with plato and aristotle .	10.591638
for plato , `` imitation ' ' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence .	76.22018
all artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations ' ' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic ' ' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect .	15.243952
in plato ' s judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers .	80.91288
presupposed in plato ' s system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .	32.60127
aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level .	94.88577
the poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation ' ' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did plato .	57.08663
but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .	51.441055
for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality .	47.968822
the central concern of erich auerbach ' s impressive volume called mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .	96.13651
following the theme of incarnation in the gospels , the christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures ' ' of divine power and reality .	63.145885
here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent .	44.649075
artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama .	47.665653
the artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction .	38.29883
he is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped .	36.087097
i have chosen to use the word `` mimesis ' ' in its christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .	56.633495
in the first instance , `` mimesis ' ' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations .	28.113472
by `` image ' ' is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith .	50.54156
this is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .	60.61817
mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself .	47.662018
the images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately	70.80713
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another .	31.131456
they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality .	71.47724
as in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images .	47.102245
mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense .	14.056951
a word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene ' ' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings .	33.507103
similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field .	45.858074
a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .	22.054445
the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials .	33.899593
when words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .	80.14995
these are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice .	71.62248
the presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood .	76.1048
underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .	84.25299
experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect .	47.07207
neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs .	108.89144
primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc . ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities .	40.96249
in contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers .	96.22273
the most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself	86.53355
a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part .	140.99303
these desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one ' s good , others threatening ill .	103.61156
gone is the tabula rasa of the mind .	42.11893
in its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one ' s life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .	99.4854
the principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy ' ' is alfred north whitehead .	42.701145
our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future .	91.64172
we feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening .	164.51497
later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience .	37.909695
it takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one ' s world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection .	105.762924
whitehead is here questioning david hume ' s understanding of the nature of experience	39.380657
he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from hume ' s presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived .	34.36157
what hume calls `` sensation ' ' is what whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy ' ' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy .	13.125533
as long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism .	53.414303
whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world .	90.41056
in this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct .	88.650406
a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past .	6.0369496
both i and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which i now am .	96.54228
after only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree ' ' , to be sure .	19.074646
there were more indications by the mid-twentieth century .	5.6757903
i leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but i noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from memphis to hattiesburg .	39.903214
in town after town my companion pointed out the negro school and the white school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) .	55.105324
it really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by booker t . washington had been going on .	114.88874
but with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired .	46.700172
for over a hundred years southerners have felt that the north was picking on them .	18.069153
it ' s infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .	161.87747
by what right of superior virtue , southerners ask , do the people of the north do this ? ?	55.416313
the traditional strategy of the south has been to expose the vices of the north , to demonstrate that the north possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that ' ' as james ' s christopher newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad i may be , you ' re not quite the people to say it ' ' .	57.39859
in the pre-civil war years , the south argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the north .	41.32051
at the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there ' s no more of the true spirit of `` integration ' ' in the north than in the south .	44.227272
people talk about `` the law of the land ' ' .	4.335187
but people can ' t be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by southern standards ) by law .	89.17434
i was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to n . v . peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the european middle ages , one in american history , and one in the far east ) , and i asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy ' ' ( francis thompson ' s words for the hound of heaven ' s pursuit ) by judicial fiat .	38.424885
they didn ' t seem to be able to think of any .	25.666597
a virginia judge a while back cited a roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .	46.34772
but i suspect that the old roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which tacitus was talking about when he said , `` they make a desert , and call it peace ' ' ( `` solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant ' ' .	44.615746
moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable	18.305164
mr . justice taney ' s dred scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the north , and soon became a dead letter .	46.207443
prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated northeast ! !	67.614204
the cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .	59.500893
the declaration of independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed ' ' .	48.722214
the phrase `` consent of the governed ' ' needs a hard look .	80.62126
how do we define it ' ' ? ?	1.0063968
is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? ?	22.902555
calhoun dealt with this question in his `` disquisition on government ' ' .	19.456911
to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority ' ' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation ' ' .	32.24942
who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ?	120.69788
that regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ?	1.1595968
that the court order does not unequally affect the southern region ? ?	37.488453
who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal action is incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed ' ' ? ?	12.960125
a friend of mine in new mexico said the court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell .	102.30312
he seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .	89.33957
i murmured something about a possible difference between new mexico ' s history and mississippi ' s .	29.261862
one can meet with aloofness almost anywhere the thidiu viewpoint , it doesn ' t affect us ! !	19.86812
southern liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they ' re rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .	67.67991
the trouble here is that it ' s almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn ' t cost you anything .	75.94646
you ' ve already sent your daughter to miss x ' s select academy for girls and your son to mr . y ' s select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .	38.67875
if there ' s no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there ' s always new england .	29.669968
new england academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , south as well as west .	37.078777
they may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from thailand , or any place other than the american south .	120.83592
it would be interesting to know how much `` integration ' ' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of new england .	29.508135
a recent newspaper report said there were five negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at yale	66.41268
that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish ' ' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national ' ' .	21.621363
i must confess that i prefer the liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith .	38.384155
i leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are .	61.51504
i ' m talking about the grand manner of the liberal -- north and south -- who is not affected personally .	63.840195
if these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ?	129.7468
) , what voices would be left ? ?	1.0080492
well , after everybody has followed the new england pattern of segregating one ' s children into private schools , only the poor folks are left .	83.833046
and it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .	95.55978
a dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the south and has spent many years in new england , said to me not long ago `` i can ' t forgive new england for rejecting all complicity ' ' .	66.680786
being a teacher of american literature , i remembered whittier ' s `` massachusetts to virginia ' ' , where he said `` but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown ' ' .	30.779963
there is a legend ( hawthorne records it in his `` english notebooks ' ' .	23.90119
and one finds it again in thomas nelson page ) to the effect that the mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of negro slaves .	61.844128
whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .	76.429375
it is something which most of us try to get out from under .	52.908615
like the cowboy in stephen crane ' s `` blue hotel ' ' , we run around crying , `` well , i didn ' t do anything , did i ' ' ? ?	20.58303
robert penn warren puts it this way in `` brother to dragons ' ' `` the recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence ' ' , where innocence , i think , means about the same thing as redemption .	35.787632
a man must be able to say , `` father , i have sinned ' ' , or there is no hope for him .	23.868725
lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` second inaugural ' ' that god `` gives to both north and south this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came ' ' .	75.961845
he also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman ' s two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil ' ' .	14.60114
lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of new englanders engaged in the slave trade .	31.204952
after how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ? ?	107.96247
it is a question which new englanders long ago put out of their minds .	43.855053
but didn ' t they get off too easy ? ?	29.672562
the slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave-owners they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth	22.74727
they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care .	25.76309
emerson -- platonist , idealist , doctrinaire -- sounded a high transcendental note in his `` boston hymn ' ' , delivered in 1863 in the boston music hall amidst thundering applause `` pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim .	21.249178
the slave is owner , and ever was .	212.81578
it is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist .	23.117264
it ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) .	59.23304
like pilate , they had washed their hands .	16.950504
can god be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ?	50.863064
new englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the declaration of independence , as jefferson explained in his `` autobiography ' ' ``	23.815313
the clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of africa was struck out in complaisance to south carolina and georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .	35.608288
our northern brethren also i believe felt a little tender under those censures	47.695286
for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others ' ' .	79.65552
george w . cable ( naturalized new englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` paradise road , northampton ' ' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` southern question ' ' .	29.138617
it was nice to be able to isolate it .	8.089126
new england , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the nation .	27.466291
there one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the united states .	23.85717
it is true that new england , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start .	108.9707
but i think that something more than this is involved .	92.84894
how did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of american democracy , failed to flourish in new england as it did in other parts of the country ? ?	32.786877
isn ' t it a bit odd that the three states of southern new england ( massachusetts , connecticut , and rhode island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been a & m colleges ? ?	72.51811
was it supposed , perchance , that a & m ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the new england world in the post-civil war period , the immigrants having been brought in from southern europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the west ? ?	52.57056
is it not ironical that roger williams ' s state , rhode island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? ?	45.25697
the state universities of maine , new hampshire , and vermont are older and more `` respectable ' '	30.983904
a yale historian , writing a few years ago in the yale review , said `` we in new england have long since segregated our children ' ' .	23.650301
he was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .	153.77303
and what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! !	190.01132
i don ' t propose to go into their history , but i have one or two surmises .	72.185844
one is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children .	107.54561
in the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory .	86.545845
among the recipients of the nobel prize for literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of english .	110.571594
of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than verner von heidenstam , the swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .	23.828566
equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of sweden in the past and continues it into the present .	22.966593
in the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .	33.33994
heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .	19.749182
on his father ' s side he was of german descent , on his mother ' s he came of the old swedish nobility .	43.27834
the family estate was situated near vadstena on lake vattern in south central sweden .	29.217218
it is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations .	62.194946
as a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of sweden ' s ancient glory .	24.396885
he liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part .	76.521706
being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in italy , then in greece , egypt , asia minor , and palestine .	50.466087
in one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .	38.39727
deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of gerome in paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .	39.78285
he gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` the happy artists ' ' .	21.346638
`` i scanned the world through printed symbol swart , and through the beggar ' s rags i strove to see the inner man .	25.29698
i looked unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart ' ' .	30.032255
in this final line , we have the key to his nature .	115.35392
few writers have better understood their deepest selves .	4.1277475
it may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in paris .	62.74588
the first result of heidenstam ' s long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , pilgrimage and wander-years ( vallfart och vandringsar ) , published in 1888 .	16.429855
it was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did byron ' s childe harold .	52.36004
professor fredrik book , sweden ' s foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows `` in this we have the verse of a painter	60.69409
strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid .	18.237719
in a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic	308.0255
all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively .	47.148808
the young poet-painter reproduces the french life of the streets	135.45802
he tells stories of the thousand and one nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of damascus .	20.946293
in the care-free indolence of the east he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it .	79.42511
and yet amid all the gay hedonism in pilgrimage and wander-years is a cycle of short poems , `` thoughts in loneliness ' ' , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing ' ' .	15.190511
of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` nameless and immortal ' ' , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the swedish language .	37.934273
it celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of neptune at paestum , next to the parthenon the noblest example of grecian classic style now in existence .	25.253471
on the eve of his return to their native naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .	46.321186
the supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .	36.60166
not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .	51.190796
`` the man ' s true reputation is his work ' ' .	30.845903
the short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` thoughts in loneliness ' ' is , as professor book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .	48.901577
it consists of fragmentary personal revelations , such as `` the spark ' ' `` there is a spark dwells deep within my soul .	18.068245
to get it out into the daylight ' s glow is my life ' s aim both first and last , the whole .	71.86874
it slips away , it burns and tortures me .	16.916904
that little spark is all the wealth i know , that little spark is my life ' s misery ' ' .	33.982796
a dominant motive is the poet ' s longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations `` not men-folk , but the fields where i would stray , the stones where as a child i used to play ' ' .	49.326843
he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading .	64.29199
what he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause ' ' to which he can honestly devote himself .	27.100965
this restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in sweden .	64.5667
his cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present .	30.663624
he did not , however , find himself at once .	43.133015
his next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled hans alienus , which professor book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .	19.10883
the hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the east , a sort of faustus type , who , to quote from professor book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .	43.56419
he is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of tiveden ' ' .	6.962582
from this time on heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .	37.379303
by the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions .	43.449207
he did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .	80.44818
like his friend and contemporary august strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .	39.546627
he saw sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory .	32.75512
strindberg ' s remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up .	61.645008
heidenstam ' s conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past .	21.336233
whether in prose or poetry , all of heidenstam ' s later work was concerned with sweden .	35.170372
with the first of a group of historical novels , the charles men ( karolinerna ) , published in 1897-8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career .	16.331217
in scope and power it can only be compared to tolstoy ' s war and peace .	48.319145
about one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .	67.40027
though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of charles 12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself .	38.274082
hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king	50.05628
on the fatal battlefield of poltava , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people ' ' .	31.783018
the charles men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .	53.6148
somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature .	80.17055
they comprise a great variety of scene and interest grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters .	23.461817
almost nothing is said of charles ' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat .	30.18651
to carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .	60.19556
his peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity .	286.81085
george meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .	37.9107
of few authors is this more true than of heidenstam .	94.95666
the charles men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .	113.28541
the career of charles 12 , is obviously very similar to that of napoleon .	126.48704
his ideal was alexander of macedon , as napoleon ' s was julius caesar .	13.930274
his purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .	16.988987
each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .	58.12852
each failed catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .	69.99762
each is still glorified as a national hero .	2.9106915
the first half of the charles men , ending on the climax of the battle of poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second .	24.79407
after the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .	37.638058
like napoleon , he was the worst of losers .	6.6351976
there are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the swedes in adversity .	20.691208
then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .	23.392696
this comes out in `` when the bells ring ' ' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern sweden to repel an invasion by the danes .	17.035608
in `` the king ' s ride ' ' , charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years .	26.166298
he finds it in utter misery and desolation .	1.8963329
all his people ask for is no more war .	385.31772
but he plunges into yet another , this time with norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died .	35.08135
then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .	179.02837
from being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of sweden .	27.971392
this is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , `` a hero ' s funeral ' ' , written in the form of an impassioned prose poem .	20.446321
slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories .	27.833527
the guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .	20.554665
as he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .	32.617844
heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in swedish memory .	54.05151
excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of the charles men , and need not detain us here .	75.22199
it is different with his volume the swedes and their chieftains ( svenskarna och deras hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .	36.237137
admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to swedish history for readers of other countries .	88.04139
some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .	23.846827
especially touching is the chapter , `` the little sister ' ' , about a king ' s daughter who became a nun in the convent of st . birgitta .	14.742428
gustaf vasa is a superb example , and charles 10 , , the conqueror of denmark , hardly less so .	81.360435
of gustavus adolphus and charles 12 , it is unnecessary to speak .	15.3491955
today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not .	52.929356
it is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited .	17.332596
the mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways .	57.53077
on the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed .	38.769302
as a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client .	116.48132
for this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine .	59.050438
on the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases	119.24855
no client would ever think of asking him to do such things .	25.444439
whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder .	43.926495
operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .	112.77737
he catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished .	70.49574
thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman .	71.582054
he is , first and foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society .	20.040861
it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective .	49.158432
by virtue of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost .	49.66194
at the same time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man .	44.09562
in this way , the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds .	45.140965
he is a public servant but not a cop .	13.163896
in short , the fictional private eye is a specialized version of adam smith ' s ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare .	43.050976
in the mystery story , as in the wealth of nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin .	59.63391
there is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement adam smith was wrong .	142.76286
not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism .	51.104847
the rise of the giant corporations in western europe and the united states dates from the period 1880-1900 .	18.217506
now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as balzac , dickens , and poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction .	42.400177
sherlock holmes , the ancestor of all private eyes , was born during the 1890s .	38.75325
thus the transformation of adam smith ' s ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life .	31.17876
driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private detective .	18.142653
the birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal .	61.35349
even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved .	32.18935
the individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct he enforces the law without being told to do so .	55.700943
but his morality rests upon that of his society .	16.48212
the basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal .	39.94879
unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good .	117.335846
as capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma .	46.154053
if he is good , he may not be legal	131.8699
if he is legal , he may not be good .	50.978275
it is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story .	11.41347
with the advent of sir arthur conan doyle ' s sherlock holmes , the development of the modern private detective begins .	19.560757
he is very close to being a mental case .	70.19412
a brief list of the great detective ' s little idiosyncrasies would provide dr . freud with ample food for thought .	61.23926
holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants	17.836834
he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln	9.50489
he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist .	11.150442
holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds .	143.56383
his eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom .	2.8828964
it was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that holmes became a detective in the first place .	25.774586
as he informs watson , `` my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence .	36.370155
these little problems help me to do so ' ' .	6.7309833
holmes is a public servant , to be sure	4.0952797
but the society which he serves bores him to tears .	13.669333
the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior .	21.633356
although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland yard , holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police .	67.79134
they for their part are convinced that holmes is too `` unorthodox ' ' and `` theoretical ' ' to make a good detective .	19.768824
why do the police find holmes `` unorthodox ' ' ? ?	3.6172352
on the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine .	58.26163
another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by watson when he observes on several occasions that holmes would have made a magnificent criminal .	63.606472
watson ' s insight is verified by the mysterious link between holmes and his arch-opponent , dr . moriarty .	10.071928
the two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness .	24.989143
the first series of sherlock holmes adventures ends with holmes and moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff .	9.503182
they are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace .	26.1499
linked to holmes even in death , moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .	58.619328
just as holmes the eccentric stands behind holmes the detective , so holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both .	51.711914
in the modern english `` whodunnit ' ' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared .	25.188787
hercule poirot and lord peter whimsey ( the respective creations of agatha christie and dorothy sayers ) have retained holmes ' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits .	17.883963
it is true that they are also extremely dull .	12.912493
their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a sherlock holmes .	18.833906
the latter ' s real descendents were unable to take root in england	36.302036
they fled from the victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy atlantic .	35.009766
in the american `` hardboiled ' ' detective story of the ' 20s and ' 30s , the spirit of the mad genius from baker street lives on .	70.78836
like holmes , the american private eye rejects the social conventions of his time .	31.997093
but unlike holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt .	75.47137
surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled ' ' private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation .	25.81505
his alienation is far more acute than holmes '	3.1143274
he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast .	9.852652
with rex stout ' s nero wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane .	76.41272
wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids .	60.835056
more profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of raymond chandler ' s philip marlowe .	33.52328
in a society where everything is for sale , marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought .	71.649155
his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence .	214.94543
beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals , always alone , always despised .	46.001373
in the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care	58.452217
a similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of eric ambler and dominates the most famous of all american mystery stories , dashiell hammett ' s the maltese falcon .	10.406929
sam spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon	20.904669
but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake .	28.045494
now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer .	30.257427
for sam spade , neither crime nor virtue pays	529.6204
moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .	30.491676
because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police .	65.17071
the latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care .	20.649876
in either case , they do not appreciate the private detective ' s zeal .	20.026026
perry mason and hamilton burger , nero wolfe and inspector cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal .	96.43554
frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer	71.566696
dashiell hammett ' s red harvest provides a classic example of this theme .	47.659515
but even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye .	26.470459
he is , like phillip marlowe , too alienated to be reliable .	12.999559
finally , in the maltese falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion sam spade becomes the chief murder suspect .	84.74068
in order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend .	47.27509
what was only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock holmes now appears as a direct accusation the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .	61.27814
it is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma .	24.743
by upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption .	19.527472
that society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo , a potential criminal .	33.549385
if the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .	54.168163
he must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel .	60.47197
on the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism .	36.724957
dashiell hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits .	98.82022
in order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man .	48.295723
the first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by mickey spillane ' s mike hammer .	12.966141
at first glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors .	33.13755
he kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge , jury and executioner rolled into one .	138.56458
it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in table 1 .	37.800102
great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network .	37.97522
by monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers .	46.351788
as a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation .	129.7664
for example , suppose a man wearing a $200 watch , driving a 1959 rolls royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` what time is it ' ' ? ?	41.68248
this sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car .	29.257504
if the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation .	37.937256
also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command .	72.36039
however , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to table 1 .	88.599365
on this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .	6.146791
presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host ' s desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors .	33.824654
the party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another .	124.82525
the information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is received by the ears .	67.88865
since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net .	54.413605
as shown in figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points .	51.493046
this , and other qualifications , make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up .	109.432274
all four types of message listed in table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more than customarily encouraged .	27.830017
the completeness of the connections provide that , for n people , there are af lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( 1 , 225 ) for a party of fifty guests .	63.59082
looking at the diagram , we see that af connection lines come in to each member .	277.75238
thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness .	83.068634
in spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the af incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if n exceeds about six .	73.86795
the crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes .	70.58373
for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers , then the `` open house ' ' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door .	91.172516
we consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence .	24.936527
we assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in figure 2 .	37.569195
information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- , third- , and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor .	6.979324
in figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number .	36.05514
the numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors .	4.524415
it will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors , h and e have six , and p has only one , while the remaining points have intermediate numbers .	171.47816
in any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens .	131.22076
a point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n .	140.63205
the dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort .	68.45335
since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp .	77.61801
location theorists have given these matters much consideration .	6.6736565
the networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war .	54.56199
they also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored .	111.332855
without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party .	5.5723834
the need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling .	30.163086
alexander the great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once .	121.3309
as time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased .	33.445827
next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value .	116.777016
on the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in figure 3 .	24.92642
the monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence .	46.77744
no questions , statements , or explanations are permitted -- only commands .	91.30565
commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank .	63.503975
the same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal .	42.982372
all orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks .	22.554432
even the officer in charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring .	70.887024
this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility .	180.96906
are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound	689.3831
and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground .	21.036703
this monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop .	86.67767
with troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication .	22.826328
years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard .	72.23984
in contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal .	43.553295
in the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior .	29.420092
a military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command .	99.57377
this objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action .	13.661719
the connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village .	45.57789
the assumptions upon which the example shown in figure 3 is based are ( a ) one man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc . .	63.456604
( b ) a message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times .	61.881413
( c ) decisions of a general kind are made by the central command .	78.50363
and ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank .	53.181103
these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel .	71.99173
the number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55 , 987 men .	80.69126
this organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .	27.29916
of types of message listed in table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in figure 3 .	67.34653
a further regulation is that commands always go down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go up , unaccompanied by commands .	42.012123
questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor .	69.61619
it will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice .	165.95303
furthermore , the network in figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the like are interlaced .	96.79521
not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks .	58.525906
such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach .	62.838425
this is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the germans or swiss , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the finns in geochemistry .	35.67633
we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes .	67.446144
this problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis .	28.59279
since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it .	92.798485
first , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist .	12.324099
but , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such .	68.78155
for example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only x-rays , applying only the powder technique of x-ray diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites	43.48329
or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven andean indians .	30.46421
so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more .	36.297314
american democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the american democratic faith .	26.112957
those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 .	31.210634
and he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law .	45.54009
i want to say more about gabriel ' s so-called fundamental law .	18.400526
but first i want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it .	56.293312
he points out that from the time of jackson on through world war 1 , , evangelical protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of america .	48.674507
he terms this early enthusiasm `` romantic christianity ' ' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical protestantism ' ' .	43.976856
let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme .	85.65743
he says `` beside the protestant philosophy of progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the united states to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy ' ' .	29.755228
he specifies , `` in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian supernaturalism , in the twentieth century it was affected by naturalism .	12.878791
but in every period it has been humanism ' ' .	4.3683386
and let me add , utopianism , also .	202.41072
some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay i called the leader follows -- where ? ?	175.0544
i used his polarity to illustrate what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call progressivism .	84.76193
it seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .	29.368002
that is to say gabriel ' s fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more .	57.255707
it is a weakness of gabriel ' s analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy .	65.02837
and with progressivism the religion of humanity was replacing what gabriel called christian supernaturalism .	67.04447
and the common man was developing mythic power , or charisma , on his own .	26.363695
during the decade that followed , the common man , as that piece put it , grew uncomfortable as the voice of god and fled from behind saint woodrow ( wilson ) only to learn from science , to his shocked relief that after all there was no god he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow -- that there was a chemical formula for him , and that too much couldn ' t be expected of him .	69.63312
the socialism implicit in the slogan of the roosevelt revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution , or of the jacksonian frontier .	75.09573
what had happened to the common man ? ?	1.0262215
french egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of popularism .	18.931322
the riotous onrush of industrialism after the war for southern independence and the general secular drift to the religion of humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the french revolution ' s socialistic offspring of one sort of another .	44.781998
the first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under wilson .	115.91257
moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s , the dislocations of the depression , the common ethos of materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced mike fink and the great gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the little people .	24.167645
however , it is important to trace the philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former .	49.534973
that john locke ' s philosophy of the social contract fathered the american revolution with its declaration of independence , i believe , we generally accept .	26.741062
yet , after rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the general will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the french revolution also .	83.52847
the importance of rousseau ' s twist has not always been clear to us , however .	36.6226
this notion of the general will gave rise to the commune of paris in the revolution and later brought napoleon to dictatorship .	34.102985
and it is clearly argued by lord percy of newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , the heresy of democracy , and in a more general way by voegelin , in his new science of politics , that this same rousseauan idea , descending through european democracy , is the source of marx ' s theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat .	34.99926
this is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after world war 2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace .	85.03579
the long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under a socialist state .	51.400047
and the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar .	18.81197
and by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually marxist .	51.46851
we will recall that the still confident liberals of the truman administration gathered with other western utopians in san francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world the united nations .	84.21997
we of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation .	60.83688
then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .	51.91337
during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal .	42.632072
during the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon the atom bomb .	66.69443
in 1952 , it will be remembered , the g . o . p . without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly .	46.04544
all of this , i know , is recent history familiar to you .	526.7349
but i have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under eisenhower ' s leadership .	60.41326
a perceptive journalist , sam lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates .	25.021025
he opens his discourse , however , with a review of the eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age .	67.10892
the show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .	53.202995
lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue .	30.258968
and i select this sentence as its pertinent summation `` in essence the drama of his ( eisenhower ' s ) presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism ' ' .	57.978786
i will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism .	33.112965
it has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused .	18.846495
obviously there has been no agreement on what american conservatism is , or rather , what it should be .	73.75835
for it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began .	70.85742
i saw a piece the other day assailing william buckley , author of man and god at yale and publisher of the national review , as no conservative at all , but an old liberal .	71.04559
but i ' m not here to define conservatism .	95.734726
what i am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course .	42.52465
one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , i suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with eisenhower conservatism .	32.562325
though , to be sure , we gave kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment .	70.6658
this is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise .	50.55454
but before i try to diagnose it , i would offer other evidence .	98.28853
i will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year .	72.82632
the earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by life magazine , under the title of the national purpose .	34.20237
the contributors to this testament were all well-known a former democratic candidate for president , a new deal poet , the magazine ' s chief editorial writer , two newspaper columnists , head of a national broadcasting company , a popular protestant evangelist , etc . .	40.384075
what i want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception .	49.5039
i suppose we might classify billy graham as an old liberal .	115.77608
and i would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- sang in one key or another the same song .	101.75652
its refrain was `` let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation ' ' .	10.781233
adlai stevenson expressed some reservations about this return .	3.8497455
only walter lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes ' ' .	42.857662
but the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent .	6.996107
the second specific comment was the report of eisenhower ' s commission on national goals , titled goals for americans .	49.259045
they , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that eisenhower requested that the commission be administered by the american assembly of columbia university , because it was non-partisan .	34.527172
the commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism .	45.528027
and here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above `` the paramount goal of the united states set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity ' ' .	66.292076
this group is secularist and their program tends to be technological .	22.440117
but it is the need to undertake these testaments that i would submit here as symptom of the common man ' s malaise .	23.409657
and let me add murray ' s new book as another symptom of it , particularly so in view of the attention time magazine gave it when it came out recently .	94.63599
father murray goes back to the declaration of independence , too , though i may add , with considerably more historical perception .	97.506996
i will reserve discussion of it for a moment , however , to return to president kennedy .	35.617104
as symptomatic of the common man ' s malaise , he is most significant a liberal and a catholic , elected by the skin of his teeth .	34.105625
does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? ?	57.491173
what is the common man ' s complaint ? ?	10.941682
let ' s take a panoramic look back over the course we have come .	53.31524
has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under eisenhower ? ?	64.13528
and the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic .	60.815567
ralph gabriel gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress .	22.266197
but there ' s a subjective side to that utopian outlook .	15.771063
does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? ?	67.01807
here there may be an analogy with cancer we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth .	50.03159
should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? ?	12.275531
and almost the only `` cure ' ' is early detection and removal .	80.968346
one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society ' s organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before .	102.546196
so an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation .	342.2617
in any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease ' ' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical .	44.983345
have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? ?	29.89468
hence the prime issue , as i see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .	72.15442
we are already committed to establishing man ' s supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today .	56.00445
otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate .	112.93693
we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .	42.6131
we must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies otherwise why try anything ? ?	137.55287
so in these pages the term `` technology ' ' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man ' s control over himself and over other men .	50.641724
naturally this includes all communication forms , e . g . languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .	17.919611
properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution .	99.34413
if we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man	66.90743
but we cannot start off with a clean slate .	7.793372
so we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man ' s major needs .	65.55694
asked which institution most needs correction , i would say the corporation as it exists in america today .	113.585556
at first glance this appears strange of all people , was not america founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring `` undeveloped ' ' societies abroad ? ?	69.21377
but hear harrison e . salisbury , former moscow correspondent of the new york times , and author of `` to moscow -- and beyond ' ' .	50.293972
in a book review of `` the soviet cultural offensive ' ' , he says , `` long before the state department organized its bureaucracy into an east-west contacts staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of american culture had carved its mark across the russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' porgy and bess ' overrode the state department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines .	46.47927
they were not diplomats or jazz musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like henry ford , hugh cooper , thomas campbell , the international harvester co . , and david w . griffith .	12.230195
their kind created an american culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies .	60.561085
this favorable image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti-american propaganda ' '	39.48589
perhaps the public ' s present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur ' ' no more exists in america .	28.463186
in his stead is a milquetoast version known as `` the corporation ' ' .	18.157452
but even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of america , foreigners can	117.30721
and our loss of `` prestige ' ' abroad is the direct result .	98.627205
no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts .	6.2911463
if we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it .	27.842186
first , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership .	140.64674
businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind .	153.50027
when we `` forced ' ' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what i would term `` pseudo-capitalism ' ' and so took a major step toward socialism .	42.310516
the biggest loss , of course , was the individual ' s lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .	38.11758
socialism , i grant , has a definite place in our society .	36.98897
but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic .	28.199015
some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society .	127.88378
but the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny .	40.626575
its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham .	22.360893
it serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that .	104.570175
as a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing ' ' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .	122.38932
as to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services .	72.73667
the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy .	34.952396
but while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole .	51.378876
so we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation ' s needs for survival .	67.80773
the corporation has a limited , specific place in our society .	12.452333
ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society .	29.97367
examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e . g . constructing major airports or dams .	65.737434
thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi-governmental institutions , subject to public control and needs .	40.24727
in all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship ' ' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .	30.70004
avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society	33.484318
and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .	47.416157
such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot .	380.5547
corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e . g . , quarterly and annual dividend reports .	13.783806
proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control	32.874687
proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community .	78.580444
corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public .	21.737795
the proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders .	63.453728
leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop .	28.811943
men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now .	137.14151
hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest .	35.160545
proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e . g . the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth .	40.39778
corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) .	74.057236
the right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated .	71.51068
to perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti-democratic .	57.089787
when the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it .	108.53263
strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole .	52.645615
strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .	47.101704
certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .	92.70088
if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? ?	33.311844
these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology .	30.679258
individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition .	16.297548
we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders .	106.24873
persons developed in today ' s corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside .	316.47766
in my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , i have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal ' ' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do .	53.010273
also , i am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , i would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees .	53.606323
any abilities i may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family .	112.30631
this combined experience , on a foundation of very average , i assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against .	181.68126
perhaps a list of some of the `` practices ' ' of my company will help here .	63.140015
the company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles .	79.28979
from an initial investment of $1 , 200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10 , 000 , 000 ( we don ' t disclose financial figures to the public ) .	41.235962

during the last years of woodrow wilson ' s administration , a red scare developed in our country .	31.712368
many americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force .	61.22332
postmaster general burleson set about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails .	41.57808
attorney general palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4 , 000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights .	32.79723
then , not many years later , the un-american activities committee , under the leadership of martin dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens .	32.269623
anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government .	45.997437
this hysteria reached its height under the leadership of senator joseph mccarthy .	6.0273485
demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions .	42.263504
new ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how .	25.381067
those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency .	78.35524
they give strict interpretation to william james ' statement that `` every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself ' ' .	53.263737
they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .	280.94656
hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .	52.201027
despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools	87.70554
they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page	130.12616
they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply .	72.60586
so all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others .	100.453064
seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away ' ' .	83.149086
that , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval .	78.89018
criminals , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds .	192.00916
merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration .	61.639538
of course , there must be clarity a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones .	48.255657
the writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st . joseph , missouri .	51.860733
an inmate , a former university professor , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts .	31.948765
he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done .	34.89908
despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of einsteinian calibre .	22.169287
true , ideas are important , perhaps life ' s most precious treasures .	13.646225
but have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance ? ?	45.574177
have we not actually developed idea worship ? ?	1.0627376
ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere .	36.166473
here we find stored the wisdom of great minds .	33.478306
but are all these works worthy of consideration ? ?	9.273217
shakespeare ' s wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries .	99.96596
but was he infallible in all things ? ?	1.0944675
what of his treatment of the jew in the merchant of venice ? ?	16.786749
shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of shylock , but probably he never saw a jew , unless in some of his travels .	41.057518
the jews had been banished from england in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years .	15.801075
if any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place .	90.19832
shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life .	46.006683
rather than from a first-hand study of jewish people , his delineation of shylock stems from a collection of italian stories , il pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier .	32.574833
he could learn at second hand from books , but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit .	102.74467
harris j . griston , in shaking the dust from shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes `` there is not a word spoken by shylock which one would expect from a real jew ' ' .	30.85863
he took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone .	39.512917
no jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater .	44.238285
it would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman .	10.60863
just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of mars , or even of tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result .	32.430916
shakespeare does not tell us that shylock was an aberrant individual .	28.992958
he sets him forth as being typical of the group .	14.851633
he tells of his `` jewish heart ' ' -- not a shylockian heart	33.975227
this would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge .	5.191957
if living jews were unavailable for study , the bible was at hand .	41.593094
reading the old testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to shylock were abhorrent to the jews .	25.028908
are we better off for having shakespeare ' s idea of shylock ? ?	16.895224
studying the merchant of venice in high school and college has given many young people their notions about jews .	123.58019
does this help the non-jew to understand this group ? ?	204.89053
thomas de torquemada , inquisitor-general of the spanish inquisition , put many persons to death .	52.973507
would we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today ' s roman catholics by saying he had a catholic heart ? ?	43.68489
let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong	28.631935
he is out of place in our times .	4.9236217
shakespeare ' s shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern world .	13.267332
ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good .	30.503056
a successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together .	43.432976
will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ? ?	94.25428
frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive .	65.77095
but is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result ? ?	44.635143
what of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? ?	95.23444
is there some magic in it that assures results ? ?	50.73576
when peter b . kyne ( pride of palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the japanese , did the heated debates of the californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? ?	23.015623
the leopard ' s spots came from the pen of thomas dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable ' ' law .	32.014767
if a child had a single drop of negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3 , 000 years .	87.43547
that doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ? ?	104.5642
in the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked .	35.39402
the son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails .	10.602294
in time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child .	14.755685
is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? ?	100.032196
will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? ?	4.4996996
for answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists .	13.057748
long ago they consigned the notions of kyne and dixon to the scrap heap .	6.4141507
false ideas surfeit another sector of our life .	3.9499564
for several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship .	6.369025
the stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress .	13.46702
children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one .	64.89886
debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one .	118.797516
research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers .	59.30859
helen deutsch informed us ( the psychology of women , vol . 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications ' ' , a conclusion accepted by many .	35.512833
will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? ?	38.39039
that is questionable , to say the least .	437.04083
research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .	38.575874
but ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough .	107.11806
in the 1930 ' s , cures for the depression literally flooded washington .	35.175865
for a time the president received hundreds of them every day , most of them worthless .	48.17963
ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate .	46.23174
when some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for instance , we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign .	83.34236
we have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory .	7.804871
the merits of the salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children .	50.762775
our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument .	4.657555
but is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems ? ?	82.56514
man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad .	146.18184
but what a super-herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy .	81.7901
we are reminded , however , that freedom of thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of ideas , is basic under our form of government .	98.9909
assuredly in our political campaigns there is freedom to think , to examine any and all issues , and to speak without restraint .	62.697426
may we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ? ?	104.2961
we must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results .	81.01619
in truth , we can say that this broke the power of senator joseph mccarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the american people .	37.397636
if he had been `` liquidated ' ' in some way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying point for people who shared his ideas .	40.806362
debate in the political arena can be productive of good .	55.04227
but it is a clumsy and wasteful process it can produce negative results but not much that is positive .	191.06844
debate rid us of mccarthy but did not give us much that is positive .	104.61013
it did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure	384.3162
it did not even provide the architect ' s plan for anything new .	37.68716
in the field of the natural sciences , scientifically verified data are quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good results .	70.4838
in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage .	67.987
by no means would we discourage the production of ideas they provide raw materials with which to work	65.42275
they provide stimulations that lead to further production .	10.479615
the president ' s personality would have opened that office to him .	137.56502
and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance .	29.56894
it is testimony to the deep respect in which mr . eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached .	54.762646
these began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the president ' s condition for the nation .	42.23384
and if howard rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the atlantic monthly accomplished a good deal more .	43.73091
it forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed .	49.38286
the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the president ' s decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem .	52.96858
because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the president , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure .	112.2653
for the president had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way .	84.73421
but the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather than a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the voters .	37.7456
any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and president in a situation which should never have arisen .	66.35269
it was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at prediction .	113.05423
in no other situation would a group of doctors , struggling competently to improve the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world , be subjected to such merciless and persistent questioning , and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces .	49.4117
and though we can look back now and see their errors , we can look back also to the ultimate error .	68.98885
it recurred in the press conferences the president ' s remarks about his running developed a singular tone , one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter .	127.00317
the press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking , rather than his convictions .	27.72795
he commented -- thoughtfully , a reporter told us -- that it was `` not too important for the individual how he ends up ' ' .	66.36089
he gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any renewed question about his running as in the battle of the bulge , he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers .	59.665283
yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought , regardless of the consequences .	60.47936
in this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears .	64.651764
the presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent .	58.491615
it is of the utmost importance to the people of america and of the world how their governing president `` ends up ' ' during the four years of his term .	81.11751
only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death .	59.326378
ironically enough , in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury .	122.549324
at the national and international level , then , what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political immorality .	69.1107
and we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us .	41.81131
for the tone of the editorials which greeted mr . eisenhower ' s original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting .	27.999622
neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people ' s intuitive sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation betraying its sense that something significant has transpired was in evidence .	42.534363
nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than the peculiar editorial page appearing in a july issue of life magazine , the issue which also carried the second announcement of the candidacy .	48.578293
the double editorial on two aspects of `` the u . s . spirit ' ' was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles great as well as small , reflecting popular approval of this questionable attitude toward the highest office in the land .	48.919605
`` the moral creed ' ' and `` the will to risk ' ' live happily together , if we do not examine where the line is to be drawn .	60.33844
`` i may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age ' ' , the president had said on february 29th of the election year , ignoring the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term .	47.50122
`` my doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great ' ' .	23.80012
but by the time the risk was doubled , events had dismissed from his mind both increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza .	130.32344
only infrequently did the situation color his thinking .	4.8871818
ironically no president we have had would have regretted more than president eisenhower the possibility to which his own words , in the press conference held at the beginning of august , testified that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country , unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation .	68.51049
so it is that we relive his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy of the present .	48.929344
no consideration of risk urges itself upon him now for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not properly focussed .	74.076485
yet with a mind less shallow , if less sharp , than some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him , he feels what he cannot formulate	84.13423
and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters .	129.31648
moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him , he adopts a position that is morally indefensible .	46.21761
he ascribes to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him .	63.456028
what is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the laws of human probability , whether or not it is later confirmed , has become by september of the election year `` a firm conviction ' ' .	58.318752
as a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place , the statement is an effective one we sympathize with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions .	53.461155
but it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history .	27.546638
in assigning to god the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors , eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration in the years to follow .	71.65582
in any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock .	57.884037
about this man we had to think twice .	4.270955
we knew that it was , as reassurance , the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature .	47.269814
but the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major decisions , and thus for imposing his will on the people .	74.909645
and in the context of drifting personal utterances we have examined , there was occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions .	28.065187
when the possibility that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision seemed to disconcert his questioners , mr . eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more .	29.802862
the portrait that had developed , fragmentarily but consistently , was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits , when it does not forestall , any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence .	61.28004
this does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked .	76.86151
instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision , as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done .	67.28701
drifting through a third illness , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president , eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking .	59.54798
despite three warnings , no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation , and thus his responsibilities , from wilson ' s .	42.529354
by contrast , the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man .	45.081303
only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked .	93.66016
in the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail , and to articulate the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant , with what is sometimes astounding rapidity .	46.967354
like lincoln , he can distinguish his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of him .	65.97109
like roosevelt , he can distinguish an attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him .	101.52001
he chooses to subordinate one to the other , sometimes reluctantly , accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed .	93.213905
the very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader .	171.16478
the capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact , and the facility with language which can render them into validity in the eyes of other men are the leader ' s means for transforming the moral intuition into moral leadership .	54.622627
the making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an inordinately difficult business .	56.45837
lincoln ' s slow progress towards the several marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such , and loosely interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision .	58.023865
but because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it , we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction , in the sphere of politics , on which decisions hang .	47.302643
only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize president kennedy ' s extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics .	46.42208
in his recent evaluation of kennedy ' s potentialities for leadership , walter lippmann has cited the `` precision ' ' of his mind , his `` immense command ' ' of factual detail , and his `` instinct for the crucial point ' ' as impressive in the extreme	29.941235
and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual ' s command of language interacts with the other two .	33.678978
for this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation .	85.99905
the liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups .	136.1173
rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration .	38.216156
the division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change .	56.283916
rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man ' s life in society .	52.91534
these ways are absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for man ' s redemption from chaos .	59.12697
the civilizational crisis , the third type of change raises the question `` what are we to do ' ' ? ?	20.332975
for the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community .	12.496186
there is no socially existential answer to the question .	12.20623
for the truth formerly experienced by the community no longer has existential status in the community , nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians .	54.03489
in this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community .	69.27323
an interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence .	355.0385
if we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke .	43.812572
the first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society .	12.163873
the first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .	9.586799
the second involves something deeper , but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for the community , not in the truth on which the community rests .	56.289288
thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself , and its phenomenological life .	46.906624
the third type , however , wrenches attention from the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the ground of being on which the community depends for its existence .	41.29656
voegelin has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable , healthy community .	34.517887
there the community , faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced .	68.60242
this , however , cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth is confused and incoherent it has no absolute standard , and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent .	72.718575
it has lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances .	13.299673
precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself .	81.3898
for paradigmatic history `` breaks ' ' rather than unfolds precisely when the movement is from order to disorder , and not from one order to a new order .	53.321423
the liberal-conservative split , to define it further , derives from a basic difference concerning the existential status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification .	72.81197
when disruptive change has penetrated to the third level of social order , the process of disruption rapidly reaches a point of no return .	93.63108
indeed , it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins .	87.8722
at that point we reach the `` closed ' ' historical situation the situation in which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante .	22.801771
at that point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously `` fate ' ' , or `` destiny ' ' , or `` providence ' ' , and feel themselves caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society .	19.371817
the reasons for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change .	23.089436
of all forms of being , society , or community , has the greatest element of determinability .	22.030418
its ontological status is itself most tenuous because apart from individual men , who are its `` matter ' ' , tradition , the `` form ' ' of society exists only as a shared perception of truth .	54.279293
the ontological status of society thus is constituted by the psychological status of society ' s members .	20.605534
the content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization .	41.213554
those social , civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group , ultimately cease to exist .	40.624496
civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused .	49.19879
civilization is what man has made of himself .	12.312422
its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself .	89.68214
it is not enough for man to be an ontological esse .	9.453278
he needs existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion .	34.786533
and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself .	46.584698
he must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not exist as man .	31.50194
thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence ' ' .	53.205948
this happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in maritain ' s words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities ' ' .	31.55125
an existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse ' ' , as existence without substance .	34.259052
thus human perception and human volition is the immanent cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the civilizational level .	77.33937
thus with regard to the loss of tradition , in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works itself out as a disruption of the individual soul , a change in which man continues as an objective ontological existent , but no longer as a man .	57.994488
further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change .	34.02062
with regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ? ?	29.74966
a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process .	99.632324
this means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .	61.53875
if the existent form is to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation .	126.08358
in the case of social decay , form is displaced simply by the process of dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process .	30.994633
now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness of the fading form .	43.069763
and when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence , any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence .	77.98458
the retention of a tradition confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation .	61.59711
however , the crisis occurs precisely as a weakening of spiritual forces .	39.158268
it would seem , therefore , that in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself .	30.02488
the emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder .	10.427078
and it would seem that history is a witness to this truth .	52.67247
as a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history .	45.672302
these differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change .	188.0002
anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition .	68.779976
to experience them , it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it .	19.061234
the process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs .	101.42692
within the individual the reaction has been called various names , all , however , pointing to the same basic experience .	73.46042
weil identifies it as being `` rootless ' ' , guardini as being `` placeless ' ' , riesman as being `` lonely ' ' .	4.4901023
others call it `` alienation ' ' , and mean by that no simple economic experience ( as marx does ) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation .	115.61455
within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one of persuasion .	20.140121
we note the use of rhetoric as a weapon , the manipulation of the masses by propaganda , the `` mobilization ' ' of effort and resources .	42.491165
within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed responses to the experience of civilizational crisis , two basic organizations of response are observable reaction and ideological progressivism .	45.523403
these responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis .	39.029938
the response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing .	49.101974
its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces .	44.968643
to this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers .	44.23899
the implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible .	29.857218
seemingly , order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by adventitious accretions .	18.773167
the problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there .	44.83987
such a response , of course , misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence .	85.736786
moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order , once the activation of change has reached visible proportions .	33.534496
the most reaction can achieve is stasis , and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself .	20.38958
despite the hopelessness of the response , it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself .	17.228006
since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class .	92.816315
their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change .	31.407402
since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze , it seldom is given adequate attention .	64.763
and the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status .	230.36684
the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational .	30.808882
but this truth is distorted by its extreme application the assumption of the separate existence of tradition .	46.967545
the reactionary misses the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations .	9.46187
reactionary theories , for this reason , usually assume some form of organismic theory .	29.159773
in its defensive formulations , the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community .	30.982027
in its dynamic form , it visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force -- the race , for instance , which unfolds in history .	25.463554
in both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality .	24.162544
when the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual defense , the characteristics of that defense are explicable only in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction .	35.438484
reaction is rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole .	30.510147
it is a total situation that is defended the `` good old days ' ' .	22.885782
even the questionable features of the past are defended .	41.472412
the point is that the reactionary , for whatever motive , perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself , something which , consequently , he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference .	76.78495
the reactionary is confused about the existential status of a decaying tradition , but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy .	47.895584
all of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work .	23.031197
is the oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ? ?	95.66696
if we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , isn ' t there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ? ?	31.36436
i am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst ' s consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life .	82.47484
a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man	104.12735
now we can argue that the irresistible fate of oedipus rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history .	35.374077
we can also argue that the three brothers karamazov and smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father ' s woman .	38.736595
but a novel in which one man karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the psychoanalytic quarterly .	67.004875
it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of oedipus complex as a literary descendant of oedipus rex .	15.970185
whatever the psychological truth in the oedipus myth , an oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret .	25.283195
but a modern oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose his own childhood is only pathetic , and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies .	45.52566
i am suggesting that a case-history approach to the oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller .	11.5590725
the best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist may have in store for him .	45.70802
incest is still a durable theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation .	55.334404
and the best way to conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story .	38.71861
which brings to mind another lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the oedipal theme .	36.310963
`` the rocking horse winner ' ' is also a story about a boy ' s love for his mother .	19.892141
if i now risk some comparisons with sons and lovers let it be clear that i am not comparing the two works or judging their merits	79.44276
i am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects .	42.58902
`` the rocking horse winner ' ' is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the reader -- but we do not know why .	33.83226
it is the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and vain mother .	36.961514
there are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse .	37.64935
the child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother .	34.7097
the story ends in the child ' s illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother .	42.360226
the child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside .	8.106514
i had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did .	104.99273
but on one occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient i began to understand the uncanny effects of this story .	49.18006
it was , of course , a little boy ' s fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal .	49.640575
how does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader ? ?	17.005907
the rocking is actually felt in the story , a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy .	25.32632
the rocking , i realized , is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message , the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child ' s fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit .	35.119743
the rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present	45.81505
and if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy .	47.062332
for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden love , doomed by its nature .	46.51885
we are also struck by the fact that this story of a boy ' s love for his mother does not offend , while the incestuous love of the man , paul morel , sometimes repels .	25.693537
we accord it its place there , and in lawrence ' s treatment we are given the innocent fantasy of a child , in fact , the form in which oedipal love is expressed in childhood .	52.55398
and when the child dies in lawrence ' s story in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make his mother rich , the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all .	46.685665
we have so completely entered the child ' s fantasy that his illness and his death are the plausible and the necessary conclusion .	56.2255
i am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood .	69.652016
it is most probable that freud and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story .	32.77461
he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told , and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged .	48.95638
he would not have cared why it emerged , he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy .	74.04766
in our own time we have seen that the novelist ' s debt to psychoanalysis has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from this marriage .	29.868446
ortega ' s hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled .	74.58218
he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights .	19.311508
he borrows the insights of psychology to improve his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a novelist ' s own .	58.41647
he has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character .	56.045967
if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior , that the ego is still the executive agency of personality , and that all we know of personality must be discerned through the ego .	92.05284
the novelist who has been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the same faces .	96.84627
i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature .	40.016464
but a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth , the joke that strikes right at the center of man ' s humanness .	60.06882
moral dread is seen as the other face of desire , and here psychoanalysis delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity .	75.25729
there is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth .	30.008057
the ancient types are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their destinies , but the myth fails before the modern truth	24.235489
the oracle speaks false and the dream speaks true .	485.16693
in both the farmer ' s tale in ralph ellison ' s invisible man and in thomas mann ' s the holy sinner , the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting the wish as motive	29.639194
the heroic act is the casting off of pretense .	5.046436
thomas mann wrote the holy sinner in 1951 .	2.4514146
it was conceived as a leave-taking , a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths of the west , `` bevor die nacht sinkt , eine lange nacht vielleicht und ein tiefes vergessen ' ' .	6.851889
he chose a medieval legend of incest , gregorius vom stein , and freely borrowed and parodied other myths of the west , mixing themes , language , peoples and times in a master myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves , as in his previous treatment of joseph .	36.292118
but the holy sinner is not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man ' s entertainment .	24.36551
mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell .	63.721558
and when he retold the legend of gregorius he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in archaic language	67.212326
while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing , they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner .	74.383606
grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister , the twins sibylla and wiligis .	25.091255
he is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast adrift soon after birth .	32.81968
the infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him .	61.55454
an ivory tablet in the infant ' s cask recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village .	29.0053
grigorss , at seventeen , learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his origins .	28.378202
his sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own country at a time when sibylla ' s domain is overrun by the armies of one of her rejected suitors .	21.498878
grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle , delivers the city from its oppressors and marries sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him .	27.821154
sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory tablet concealed by her husband , and the identities of mother and son are revealed .	19.005297
grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen years .	37.354027
at the end of this period two pious christians in rome receive the revelation which leads them to seek the next pope on the rock .	84.230736
grigorss comes to rome and becomes a great and beloved pope .	37.48243
in the last pages of the book sibylla comes to rome to seek an audience with the great pope and to give her confession .	43.241158
mother and son recognize each other and , in mann ' s version of this legend , make a remarkable confession of guilt to each other , the confession of unconscious motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the time they had first set eyes on each other .	33.21322
in recollection he has said `` natural or man-made objects kept coming into my head , but i would suppress them sternly ' ' .	21.282719
moreover , he organized the movement of his forms , within his rigorously shaped space , into highly complex equilibriums	71.361725
and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors .	58.180454
the worthy mondrian , seeing these pictures , said in a tone of kindly reproof `` but you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition ' ' ! !	34.66368
helion did not realize it at the time , but it was true .	17.018744
his `` monumental ' ' abstraction , made up of smooth , metallic `` non-objects ' ' acting upon each other with great tension , won helion much acclaim during the ' thirties .	112.50983
the play of novel lighting effects also entered into these compositions , whose controlled power and varied activity made them well worth meditating .	94.788506
as helion ' s work showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature , the pure abstractionists expressed some disapproval	67.58139
but leger , arp , lipchitz and alexander calder , at the time , gave him their blessing .	15.070103
his canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be `` figures in space ' ' , or `` blue figure ' ' , or `` pink figure ' '	17.838415
and they had ( vaguely ) heads and feet .	153.5628
exhibited in shows in london in 1935 , and in new york the following year , the new , more elaborated abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional dramas of great intellectual coherence .	28.431156
at this period the thirty-year old helion was ranked `` as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement ' ' , according to herbert read , `` and in the direct line of descent from cezanne , seurat , gris and leger ' ' .	23.04906
in america , meyer schapiro observed that , unlike the mondrian school , helion `` sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art ' ' .	35.449318
it is notable that at this time he was writing with admiration of cimabue ' s and poussin ' s way of filling space .	34.72023
abstract art was still the right path for him	27.2395
but , he held , instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction ' ' , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the raphaels and poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and mondrian .	26.823893
later helion wrote of this phase `` for years i built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name .	169.01505
i played on it my secret songs , unexplained , passionate and peaceful ' ' .	22.07622
the extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly arid and cold .	73.38864
he was engaged in constant experiments that searched for new directions .	25.479422
he himself did not know , as he said in 1935 .	37.97179
but he was `` afraid of the future -- he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration , a functional art of some kind ' ' .	66.97778
during the 1920 ' s the abstractionists , the german bauhaus group of industrial designers , and the new architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia , or welfare state , in which their neat and logical constructions might find their proper place .	81.99077
but whereas the postwar american abstractionists seem to helion to be determined to `` escape ' ' from the real world , or simply to rebel against it , the ordered abstractions which he and his associates of the 1930 ' s were painting embodied the hope of `` improving ' ' things .	57.418247
`` we were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come , very pure and elevated ' ' , he has said , `` in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918 ' ' .	43.455235
instead of this the 1930 ' s witnessed a tragic economic depression , the rise of fascist dictators in europe , the wasting civil war in spain .	19.42452
very much the political man , helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of france and all europe , whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky .	81.58117
in 1936 he decided to migrate to america .	9.440491
the rooseveltian america was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute the last best hope for civilization .	85.87349
helion also hoped that america ' s mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works .	62.54335
`` i arrived in the united states with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions ' ' .	73.82611
in new york he was well received by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists , including alexander calder , george k . l . morris , de kooning , holty and a few others .	26.853546
after a year in a studio on sheridan square , having married an american girl who was a native of virginia , helion moved to a village in the blue ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases .	35.628773
the darkening world scene , at the time of the munich pact , continued to trouble his mind even in his remote virginia studio .	32.72029
`` fear possessed me , and the certainty of war ' ' , he has related .	31.481464
`` i truly smelled blood , death , heaps of corpses everywhere ' ' .	6.583323
in haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings a three-panel frieze , with a flying figure and a fallen figure	54.23387
a `` double-figure ' ' , which went to the chicago art institute , and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts	52.180496
and in early 1939 , a `` fallen figure ' ' of very ominous character , which concluded his abstract phase .	39.178516
`` i knew i was carrying on with abstraction to its very end -- for me ' ' , he said of the two years ' output in virginia .	49.254105
with those paintings of big constructions crashing down , he felt he could stop .	173.16855
they were , in effect his last testament to non-objective art .	3.487279
he had taken out first papers for american citizenship	1.6321582
but after war came to europe , he decided to return to france , arriving there in january , 1940 .	60.178368
`` i hated the war ' ' , he said , `` but thought i ought to go because i was , perhaps , one of those who hadn ' t done enough to prevent it ' ' .	24.84029
in june , 1940 , sergeant helion , with a company of reserve troops waiting to go into battle , was sketching the hills south of the loire river , when the war suddenly rolled in upon him .	49.29698
its first apparition was a long , gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons , or pushing prams .	22.64912
his company then carried out a confused retreating movement until it was surrounded by the germans , a few days before france capitulated .	44.007847
after a sort of death march during four days without food , helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in east germany .	31.524
a year later they were removed to a stalag in the harbor of stettin .	11.04693
at the time of his capture helion had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at woolworth ' s in new york .	41.536396
when he was stripped , deloused and numbered by his guards , his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners ' goods to be confiscated .	20.892727
`` it was then i knew that they were making war against man , the individual within ! !	156.97447
-- who questioned things when given orders ' ' .	1.8577188
at stettin the university-educated artist , who had studied german , was chosen to serve as interpreter and clerk in the office of the stalag commander .	22.483326
in secret he also acted as a member of the prisoners ' central committee , which plotted sabotage , planned a few escapes , and maintained a hidden control over the wretched french slave-laborers .	41.043316
in the stalag , helion came to know and love his comrades , most of them plain folk , who , in their extremity , showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other .	58.489048
how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape .	96.11149
in the prison camp ' s black market civilian clothes were quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him	64.91619
during long weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed .	18.804108
every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories .	62.84583
one evening , while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard among the prisoners remaining there , a simulated melee was staged -- just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from work .	81.32176
four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me .	26.33884
finot held a wallet with my money and papers	2788.8933
moineau and david held nothing but their fingers .	55.552197
at this moment the volley-ball hit the ground .	4.5291624
the guards all rushed up to intervene ' '	10.723417
shedding his prison cloak , helion shot through the gates , now clad in civilian garments and with the passport of a flemish worker .	24.59128
riding trains , hitching hikes on trucks across germany , slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of secret guides , he eventually reached vichy france , and , by the winter of 1943 , was back in virginia .	33.968975
to escape from a prison camp required a very special state of mind	212.76382
not only loathing of captivity , but a faith , a hope that is even stronger .	112.49052
i left behind me brave men , whom captivity had robbed of all hope .	111.4605
they too loved their families , longed for their villages yet lacked the faith that drove one to dare the fearful chance of escape ' ' .	75.73775
it was a time of revelations for him .	5.694196
even the most rational of men , under great stress , may be transported by a new faith and behave like mystics .	57.159386
helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice of his fellow-men in arbeitskommando 13 , , stettin , as to his own fierce will and love of life .	42.582165
after that , he declared , `` to return to freedom was to fall to one ' s knees before the real world and adore it ' ' .	50.12466
in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life , his guards , his companions in misery .	57.204323
now all his desires centered on `` rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence ' ' .	60.09796
and , he added `` during the many months in prison camp , all abstract images vanished from my mind ' ' .	37.585724
before leaving for america , he happened to see his old friend jean arp and confided to him his new resolutions .	34.535595
arp protested `` but it is impossible ! !	1.1519704
everything in the way of representation has already been done by the old masters ' ' .	21.307306
helion , however , clung to the belief that `` in escaping from the stalag i had also escaped from abstraction ' ' .	23.849066
while convalescing in his virginia home he wrote a book recording his prison experiences and escape , entitled they shall not have me published originally in ( helion ' s ) english by dutton & co . of new york , in 1943 , the book was received by the press as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic accounts of world war 2 , from the french side .	55.44549
and the author , who seemed the embodiment of france ' s rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors , was much complimented for his daring military action .	57.272964
but when he showed his new figurative pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp , they paid him no compliments and drew long faces .	85.64791
between 1944 and 1947 helion had a series of one-man shows -- at the paul rosenberg gallery in new york and in paris -- of his new realistic pictures .	31.660906
they reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920 ' s .	26.631962
these new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom the cafe at the corner , the newspaper kiosk , the girls in doorways and windows along the street , the golden-crusted french bread they lacked , the cigarettes denied them .	48.281464
one of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette	67.219444
others were of men doffing their hats to each other , carrying umbrellas with pomp , reading newspapers , or simply showing loaves of bread spread out .	42.39771
important as was mr . o ' donnell ' s essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously has .	80.413284
he and also mr . cowley and mr . warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- nathaniel hawthorne , for example , and herman melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs .	38.492424
faulkner ' s total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when mr . cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when mr . o ' donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the south .	56.13377
if he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist .	5.3703475
if he condemns the recent or the present , he condemns the past with no less force .	108.850075
if he sees the heroic in a sartoris or a sutpen , he sees also -- and he shows -- the blind and the mean , and he sees the compson family disintegrating from within .	52.980328
if the barn-burner ' s family produces a flem snopes , who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the compson family produces a jason compson 4 .	11.146915
others writing on faulkner have found the phrase `` traditional moralist ' ' either inadequate or misleading .	23.071234
among them are frederick j . hoffman , william van o ' connor , and mrs . olga vickery .	11.229045
they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , i believe , in pointing out faulkner ' s independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the southern tradition .	77.78755
faulkner ' s is not the mind of the apologist which mr . o ' donnell implies that it is .	15.599627
he is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at oxford , mississippi , thirty-five years ago .	46.451904
that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books .	32.461277
it is to say rather , i believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .	51.558918
he has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed southern .	74.92276
the fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern , i rather think , for the south has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .	119.26788
some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly southern traits .	33.845596
there is no necessity , i suppose , to assert that mr . faulkner is southern .	62.986893
it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family .	71.439384
and , after all , he has lived comfortably at both oxford , mississippi , and charlottesville , virginia .	39.228622
the young william faulkner in new orleans in the 1920 ' s impressed the novelist hamilton basso as obviously conscious of being a southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so .	51.242317
besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the south during the past hundred years .	78.067924
it is more difficult with faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge .	44.272358
his own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the south , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation .	38.63021
his denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the south or have written about the south .	62.46574
but in looking at faulkner against his background in mississippi and the south , it is important not to lose the broader perspective .	56.410496
his earliest work reflected heavy influences from english and continental writers .	47.374245
evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the gothic romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , henry james and james joyce among them .	23.474966
his repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him .	120.13283
my intention , therefore , is not to say that faulkner ' s awareness has been confined within the borders of the south , but rather that he has looked at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook is southern .	40.506714
the ingredients of faulkner ' s novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him .	100.42615
a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , i think , by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region .	140.1998
the planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton kennedy published swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of southern literature .	44.2173
the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .	45.052895
as they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed .	46.015724
their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the south , even while memories of the war were still sharp .	101.75696
the tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of thomas nelson page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel so red the rose , by stark young .	52.01263
although faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have stark young ' s inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society .	34.20277
the myth of the southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as francis pendleton gaines showed forty years ago , and i suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed .	52.44741
faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook .	44.202553
without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the sartoris and the compson families faulkner ' s chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the civil war .	36.25999
it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of ellen glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society .	47.17174
faulkner ' s low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels dealing with plantation life .	91.35007
they have an ancestry extending back , however , at least to 1728 , when william byrd described the lubberlanders he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina .	37.196007
the chief literary antecedents of the snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated in the south and the southwest in the three decades before the civil war .	25.619038
these narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of horace , mr . addison , mr . pope , and sir walter scott .	63.554688
there is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south .	37.504063
william gilmore simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him .	37.44353
simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully .	34.587135
augustus baldwin longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character ransy sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him .	50.141785
others who wrote of low characters and low life included thomas bangs thorpe , creator of the big bear of arkansas and tom owen , the bee-hunter	22.378002
johnson jones hooper , whose character simon suggs bears a close kinship to flem snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will	33.74079
and george washington harris , whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature .	26.487467
it would be profitable , i believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkner ' s works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to faulkner ' s time .	61.89758
such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality in the south and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent .	83.75853
such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of longstreet and hooper and harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers	61.471207
nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters .	36.590633
one of the early humorists already mentioned , thomas bangs thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials .	104.79571
thorpe came to louisiana from the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty .	42.697533
but thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions .	30.192959
as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble , arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano	57.131596
and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` the big bear of arkansas ' ' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature .	14.972136
some years ago julian huxley proposed to an audience made up of members of the british association for the advancement of science that `` man ' s supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are ( now ) in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice age ' ' .	52.71143
as a humanist , dr . huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development , and one thing we can say about this suggestion , which comes from a leading zoologist , is that , so far as he is concerned , the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution .	56.50984
this text from dr . huxley is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic powers in human beings .	24.271402
there may be a case of this sort , but it is not one we wish to argue , here .	30.43295
even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one another ' s minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man ' s mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books .	72.3605
even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners , one may question whether this will help them to live better lives .	119.24798
there would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course	18.517826
such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists	31.92592
but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article .	72.97621
all we want from dr . huxley ' s statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next , and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible .	54.04602
it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one , but many .	50.20646
each man , that is , is both one and many .	263.30493
he is a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect , and he is an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of his time .	69.62014
he is a parent with a child to nurture , here and now , and he is an educator who worries about the children half way round the world .	77.67888
he is a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the circumstances of today .	68.30837
he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself .	40.989006
he is a craig ' s wife who agonizes about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the local university have come to call .	46.877934
he is the stern guardian of the status quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age , and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed .	40.490223
what will be the final symmetry of the good society ? ?	108.49325
here , on a desk , is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions .	48.22975
the pamphlets are about law , the corporation , forms of government , the idea of freedom , the defense of liberty , the various lethargies which overtake our major institutions , the gap between traditional social ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their realization .	59.296173
the thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological ardor .	20.575926
there is another kind of ardor , a quiet , sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life , but no angry utopian contentions .	36.753696
actually , you could wish for some passion , now and then , but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos of current history which partisan social passions have wrought , you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized calm .	52.42197
you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity .	21.962107
there is essential pleasantness in reading the writing of men who are not angry , who can contend without quarreling .	57.658283
this is the good kind of sophistication , and with all our problems and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the united states during recent years .	42.992172
a characteristic expression of such concern and inquiry is found in joseph p . lyford ' s introduction to the agreeable autocracies , a recent paperback study of the institutions of modern democratic society .	36.08251
mr . lyford gives voice to a temper that represents , we think , an achieved plateau of reflective thinking .	69.363205
after casting about for a way of describing this spirit , we decided that it would be better to use mr . lyford ' s introduction as an illustration .	29.629522
at one time it seemed as if the soviet union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations .	72.34876
as things turned out , however , we have not profited greatly from the lesson instead of persistently following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever soviet policy seemed to be at the moment .	93.40019
such activity may or may not have irritated the kremlin , but it has frequently condemned america to an unnatural defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the free world .	25.127192
the defensiveness has been exaggerated by another bad habit , our tendency to rate the `` goodness ' ' or `` badness ' ' of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate about ourselves .	28.695408
since the slogans have little application to reality and are sanctimonious to boot , the applause is faint even in areas of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection for free government .	50.632236
shocked at the response to our proclamations , we grow more defensive , and worse , we lose our sense of humor and proportion .	47.420113
mr . nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by our department of state , and an american president observes sourly that sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic ' ' .	26.895554
one thing you can say about mr . lyford is that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an american .	33.158115
those who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination .	6.424912
the maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood .	71.480484
even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society .	124.21611
we would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries .	90.34132
the picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of american life .	17.286272
the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate is great , and it does not escape the notice of others .	56.98633
if our sincerity is granted , and it is granted , the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest self-examination .	58.06602
what is more , the legends have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smells of low treason , and men who practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels .	21.133186
although we continue to pay our conversational devotions to `` free private enterprise ' ' , `` individual initiative ' ' , `` the democratic way ' ' , `` government of the people ' ' , `` competition of the marketplace ' ' , etc . , we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in large areas , bureaucracy is corroding representative government , technology is weakening the citizen ' s confidence in his own power to make decisions , and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground ' ' .	32.707523
the interesting thing about mr . lyford ' s approach , and the approach of the contributors to the agreeable autocracies ( oceana publications , 1961 ) to the situation of american civilization , is that it is concerned with comprehending the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect on american life .	20.50215
in an ideological argument , the participants tend to thump the table .	21.834017
the new spirit , so well illustrated by mr . lyford ' s work , is wholly free of this anxiety .	34.860756
the problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves ' ' .	68.43154
we experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them .	31.02351
we feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them .	75.82719
it does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on the national purpose .	108.93984
the agreeable autocracies is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today .	64.22715
the men who speculate on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world ' ' .	38.391853
these institutions which mr . lyford names `` agreeable autocracies ' ' -- where did they come from ? ?	43.84629
of one thing we can be sure they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society ' ' .	26.006596
no doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century .	24.498863
going back over this ground and analyzing the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the center for the study of democratic institutions , in santa barbara .	45.805984
but however we come , finally , to explain and account for the present , the truth we are trying to expose , right now , is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises .	64.28742
the host is the flowing life of the human race .	24.017105
this life has its own currents and rhythms , its own multiple cycles and adaptations .	20.695303
should rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory for the advent of television , atomic energy , and ibm machines ? ?	41.87378
how would thomas jefferson feel after reading factories in the field ? ?	11.515024
they tell us , sir , that we are free , because we have in one hand a ballot , and in the other a stock certificate .	78.26588
with these we shape our destiny and own private property , and that , sir , makes ours the best of all possible societies .	99.32135
the reality of the situation , however , is described by mr . lyford ``	35.148266
many of us may even be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts .	41.732727
thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall	120.53564
and the citizen narrows his political participation to the mere act of voting -- if he votes at all ' ' .	22.245823
copernicus did not question it , ptolemy could not .	31.328764
given the conceptual context within which ancient thought thrived , how could anyone have questioned this principle ? ?	133.58975
the reasons for this are partly observational , partly philosophical , and reinforced by other aesthetic and cultural factors .	21.216583
the obvious natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the heavens .	3.736149
not only did constellations like draco , cepheus , and cassiopeia spin circles around the pole , but stars which were not circumpolar rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night .	51.74988
nor did a constellation ' s stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights .	28.35403
the conclusion -- the distances of the constellations did not vary and their paths were circular .	26.53588
moreover , the sun ' s path over earth described a segment of a great circle	36.847595
this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon .	69.81458
as early as the 6th century b . c . the earth was seen to be spherical .	27.001354
earth , being at the center of the universe , would have the same shape as the latter	44.273125
so , e . g . did aristotle argue , although this may not be an observational reason in favor of circularity .	19.389292
the discoid shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things .	48.98842
in light of all this , one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular .	26.765753
why , for example , should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation of the heavens to be elliptical ? ?	9.848961
there were no reasons for such suppositions then .	14.15455
this , conjoined with the considerations above , made the circular motions of heavenly bodies appear an almost directly observed fact .	97.4791
additional philosophical considerations , advanced notably by aristotle , supported further the circularity principle .	149.6892
by distinguishing superlunary ( celestial ) and sublunary ( terrestrial ) existence , and reinforcing this with the four-element physics of empedocles , aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies , which moved in only a perfect way , viz . in a perfect circle .	34.999897
it must , apparently , be motion without termini .	6.7261024
because motion which begins and ends at discrete places would ( e . g . for aristotle ) be incomplete .	70.76349
circular motion , however , since it is eternal and perfectly continuous , lacks termini .	94.09006
only imcomplete , imperfect things move towards what they lack .	62.808918
perfect , complete entities , if they move at all , do not move towards what they lack .	56.745216
they move only in accordance with what is in their natures .	19.894234
thus , circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect celestial existence .	83.65782
to return now to the four-element physics , a mixture of muddy , frothy water will , when standing in a jar , separate out with earth at the bottom , water on top , and the air on top of that .	60.216976
a candle alight in the air directs its flame and smoke upwards .	6.385951
this gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements .	36.59704
thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe .	2.8097017
it is covered ( partly ) with water , air is atop of that .	61.752186
pure fire ( the stars ) is in the heavens .	19.48522
when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material substratum , it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a scale of material-formal ratios , celestial bodies will be of a subtle , quickened , ethereal existence , in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary .	47.037617
the stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth .	74.555725
this is clear when one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to both regions .	60.296505
a projectile shot up from earth returns rectlinearly to its ' natural ' place of rest .	298.38193
but the natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest , nor rectilinear motion .	44.31378
being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake more of what is divine .	80.08329
let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between ptolemaic and copernican astronomy .	2.3394551
bluntly , there never was a ptolemaic system of astronomy .	16.193794
copernicus ' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy .	5.810811
the almagest and the hypotheses outline ptolemy ' s conception of his own task as the provision of computational tables , independent calculating devices for the prediction of future planetary perturbations .	24.064455
indeed , in the halma edition of theon ' s presentation of the hypotheses there is a chart setting out ( under six distinct headings ) otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing the planetary motions .	29.964737
no attempt is made by ptolemy to weld into a single scheme ( a-la-aristotle ) , these independent predicting-machines .	22.25821
they all have this in common the earth is situated near the center of the deferent .	15.062501
but that one should superimpose all these charts , run a pin through the common point , and then scale each planetary deferent larger and smaller ( to keep the epicycles from ' bumping ' ) , this is contrary to any intention ptolemy ever expresses .	103.77734
he might even suppose the planets to move at infinity .	8.788969
ptolemy ' s problem is to forecast where , against the inverted bowl of night , some particular light will be found at future times .	62.454872
his problem concerns longitudes , latitudes , and angular velocities .	2.6123862
the distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master , beyond crude conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth .	38.64731
but none of this has prevented scientists , philosophers , and even historians of science , from speaking of the ptolemaic system , in contrast to the copernican .	23.74303
it is engendered by confounding the aristotelian cosmology in the almagest with the geocentric astronomy .	6.5069838
ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion .	32.5722
this is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .	111.58328
so when textbooks , like that of baker set out drawings of the ' ptolemaic system ' , complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents , we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically .	88.58956
it is the chief merit in copernicus ' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent .	36.282967
he cannot , e . g . compute the retrograde arc traveled by mars , without also making suppositions about the earth ' s own motion .	30.96195
he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem .	4.4474626
in ptolemaic terms , however , eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter , to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations .	69.619576
in a systematic astronomy , like that of copernicus , retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system	35.313663
they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable , local planetary motions .	51.93579
another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic vs . copernican astronomy , turns on the idea of simplicity .	15.177105
it is often stated that copernican astronomy is ' simpler ' than ptolemaic .	43.088963
some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former .	38.984646
thus , margenau remarks `` a large number of unrelated epicycles was needed to explain the observations , but otherwise the ( ptolemaic ) system served well and with quantitative precision .	55.807766
copernicus , by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe , was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen .	14.150915
historical records indicate that copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called ' revolution ' , unaware perhaps of its historical importance , he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction .	63.621178
as an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be arithmetized	27.24671
it involves a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen ' ' .	16.14792
if in any one calculation ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once , while copernicus never required more than one third this number , then ( in the sense obvious to margenau ) ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than copernican .	53.385586
but no single planetary problem ever required of ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time .	49.967922
this , of course , results from the non-systematic , ' cellular ' character of ptolemaic theory .	45.804173
calculations within the copernican framework always raised questions about planetary configurations .	4.7538133
these could be met only by considering the dynamical elements of several planets at one time .	23.234926
this is more ambitious than ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems .	139.68591
thus , in no ordinary sense of ' simplicity ' is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the copernican .	10.981199
this was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within ptolemy ' s astronomy .	16.72903
analogously , anyone who argues that einstein ' s theory of gravitation is simpler than newton ' s , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts .	46.301277
in a sense , einstein ' s theory is simpler than newton ' s , and there is a corresponding sense in which copernicus ' theory is simpler than ptolemy ' s .	12.182877
but ' simplicity ' here refers to systematic simplicity .	14.757075
the number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum .	26.475445
the axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions .	39.948185
this characterizes euclid ' s formulation of geometry , but not ptolemy ' s astronomy .	16.633238
there are in the almagest no rules for determining in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with abberations in lunar , solar , or planetary behavior .	45.841393
the strongest appeal of the copernican formulation consisted in just this ideally , the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic ' rules ' of the theory .	87.67586
the lower-level hypotheses are never ' ad hoc ' , never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum .	107.43398
copernicus , to an extent unachieved by ptolemy , approximated to euclid ' s vision .	8.101069
de revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques .	34.24087
it is an organized system of these things .	15.2409725
solving astronomical problems requires , for copernicus , not a random search of unrelated tables , but a regular employment of the rules defining the entire discipline .	53.058094
hence , noting the simplicity achieved in copernicus ' formulation does not provide another reason for the acceptance of de revolutionibus , another reason beyond its systematic superiority .	38.02037
1543 a . d . is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution .	9.026847
it is really the funeral day of scholastic science .	20.448915
granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the de revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow .	35.932793
but , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced .	65.225395
in what does the dissatisfaction of copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?	8.466887
what in the almagest draws his fire ? ?	1.0044018
the formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being copernicus ' primary concern , was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy , namely , the ' unphysical ' triplication of centric reference-points one center from which the planet ' s distances were calculated , another around which planetary velocities were computed , and still a third center ( the earth ) from which the observations originated .	49.117275
this arrangement was for copernicus literally monstrous `` with ( the ptolemaists ) it is as though an artist were to gather the hands , feet , head and other members for his images from divers models , each part excellently drawn , but not related to a single body	87.89466
and since they in no way match each other , the result would be a monster rather than a man ' ' .	25.988768
copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy .	4.488358
his objective was , essentially , to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends .	143.96939
that such deficiencies existed within ptolemy ' s theory was not discovered de novo by copernicus .	35.457947
the critical , rigorous examinations of nicholas of cusa and nicholas of oresme provided the context ( a late medieval context ) for nicholas copernicus ' own work .	38.44983
without abandoning too much , copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable .	24.19594
he did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution .	44.319427
henrietta ' s feeling of identity with sara sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that sara ' s epitaph in the jewish cemetery in venice referred to her as `` the sulamite ' ' .	16.13385
into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and -- especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair -- into the relations of men and women `` in their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander .	44.20023
one is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette .	50.734768
the very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts	60.417152
usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly .	57.501755
she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man .	51.271854
women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld .	73.66594
she was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .	47.902493
one who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .	48.585346
in any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual	57.41504
the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .	28.278984
and , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature .	74.64878
henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition .	31.049585
dr . isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of sara sullam that he considered submitting it to the century magazine or harper ' s but he decided that its jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in the messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead ' ' .	58.359005
under her father ' s influence it did not occur to henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the jewish field , but she did begin writing for other anglo-jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience .	117.88072
and she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of judas maccabeus performed at the hanukkah festival which came in december .	21.08739
by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that papa and mamma gave her a life of dickens as a spur to her aspiration .	40.98487
another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of johns hopkins university within walking distance of home .	45.391712
it was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district , with only a few professors , but all eminent men , and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings .	32.819576
in september ' 76 thomas huxley , darwin ' s famous disciple , came from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the university	19.191982
and although it was a school for men only , it afforded henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures .	111.80816
in the following year her father undertook to give a course in hebrew theology to johns hopkins students , and this brought to the szold house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by mamma and entertained by henrietta and rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on sunday evenings .	52.048717
from philadelphia came cyrus adler and joseph jastrow .	6.0056105
adler , judge sulzberger ' s nephew , came to study assyriology .	39.731617
a smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go far .	80.64664
joseph jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , marcus jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease .	34.43647
his father was a good friend of rabbi szold , and joe lived with the szolds for a while .	25.656862
both these youths , who greatly admired henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine	76.73265
and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with papa , whose mind -- although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it -- naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were .	77.288826
besides , miss henrietta -- as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back -- had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing	53.027676
so cyrus adler became interested in her friend racie friedenwald , and joe jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as henrietta , and signed himself joe -- fell in love with pretty sister rachel .	49.871338
henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with joe ' s older and more serious brother , morris , who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia with papa , when he substituted for rabbi jastrow at rodeph shalom temple there during its rabbi ' s absence in europe .	57.38674
young morris , who , while attending the university of pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write henrietta twenty-page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of sarah bernhardt in philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` sulamith ' ' on the jewish reform movement being promulgated by the hebrew union college in cincinnati .	47.00367
unlike his younger brother , joe , he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as `` my dear friend ' ' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style .	28.954634
and when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and papa did .	75.7119
one thing papa had not taught henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .	48.388317
she could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man ' ' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies ' ' of sara sullam	23.683372
and in her forthright way , henrietta , who in her story of sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged ' ' and `` women as submissive and yielding ' ' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of dr . wise of hebrew union college -- until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything .	40.824043
but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively szolds in their pleasant house on lombard street .	53.46244
`` we ' ve got father and mother and each other ' ' said beth on the first page of louisa alcott ' s little women	47.74899
and , `` i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world ' ' , burst out jo some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the march family , which had first appeared when henrietta was eight	86.494896
and the szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the marches .	18.432276
mr . march , like benjamin szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination	22.697317
and `` marmee ' ' march , like sophie szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the marches had only four to the szolds ' five .	45.24784
but the march girls had their counterparts in the szold girls .	15.8661785
henrietta could easily identify herself with jo march , although jo was not the eldest sister .	14.36249
neither was henrietta hoydenish like jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like henrietta ' s , was the feminine form of a boy ' s name .	40.358627
but both were high-spirited and vivacious , both had tempers to control , both loved languages , especially english and german , both were good teachers and wrote for publication .	103.55994
each was her mother ' s assistant and confidante	1.6022364
and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture .	66.73693
bertha szold was more like meg , the eldest march girl , who `` learned that a woman ' s happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of ruling it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother ' ' .	51.148853
bertha , blue-eyed like mamma , was from the start her mother ' s daughter , destined for her mother ' s role in life .	11.450914
sadie , like beth march , suffered ill health -- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart -- but that never dampened her spirits .	46.536053
when her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , sadie learned to write with her left hand .	37.099937
she wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments , like `` oh , what fun ! !	48.699276
a comedy in three acts ' ' , in which , under `` personages ' ' , henrietta appeared as `` a schoolmarm ' ' , and bertha , who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than henrietta had been , appeared as `` dummkopf ' ' .	30.742546
played chopin in the `` soiree musicale of mr . guthrie ' s pupils ' '	12.576076
and she recited `` hector ' s farewell to andromache ' ' most movingly , to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in germantown near philadelphia , where the szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the jastrow boys at the szolds ' in baltimore .	26.935307
adele , like amy , the youngest of the marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one .	23.089756
for rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the szold girls -- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones -- there was no particular march counterpart	68.36217
but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian .	157.00711
the szolds , like the marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times	176.37553
and , as in the march home , any young man who called on the szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them .	63.4948
this included mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as papa had first fallen in love with her mamma before he chose her	82.96821
and when a young man like morris jastrow had enjoyed the szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the szold girls and mamma .	26.357529
and just as `` laurie ' ' lawrence was first attracted to bright jo march , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister amy , so joe jastrow , who had also been writing henrietta before he came to johns hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty rachel .	58.31575
and like jo march , who saw her sisters meg and amy involved in `` lovering ' ' before herself , henrietta saw her sisters rachel and sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , rachel by joe jastrow , and sadie by max lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the mississippi .	29.030878
olgivanna -- in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address -- was not only attractive but shrewd , durable , sensible , and smart .	34.708115
no wonder wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met .	570.5439
almost from that day , until his death , olgivanna was to stay at his side	34.751293
but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for wright and his montenegrin lady .	69.68172
it must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval .	84.84806
even so , many of the things that happened to wright and olgivanna seem inordinately severe .	51.22769
their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for .	50.488064
reporters began to trail miriam everywhere , and to encourage her to make appalling statements about wright and his doings .	33.6798
flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air .	61.7903
the distracted miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative , then change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person .	155.5137
at last her lawyer , arthur d . cloud , gave up the case because she turned down three successive settlements he arranged .	98.779236
cloud made an interesting statement in parting from his client `` i wanted to be a lawyer , and mrs . wright wanted me to be an avenging angel .	22.098343
the first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final disposition of the case .	87.27822
but every time i suggested this to her , mrs . wright turned it down and demanded that i go out and punish mr . wright .	32.886024
i am an attorney , not an instrument of vengeance ' ' .	8.717474
miriam noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor , and appointed a heavy-faced young man named harold jackson to take his place .	28.417738
and during the unhappy time , miriam often would charge that wright and olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of wisconsin .	55.6044
yet somehow , when officers were prodded into visiting taliesin to execute the warrants , they would find neither wright nor olgivanna at home .	28.200815
this showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained remains a puzzle .	153.51404
the misery of miriam ' s bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was hopeless , agonizing , and destructive , with miriam herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain .	41.58042
to get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon wright and olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by miriam in person .	50.20666
one of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at spring green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in june .	114.873566
at this time miriam noel appeared , urging on constable henry pengally , whose name showed him to be a descendant of the welsh settlers in the neighborhood .	11.400269
a troop of reporters brought up the rear .	14.012514
miriam was stopped at the taliesin gate , and william weston , now the estate foreman , came out to parley .	32.335625
he said that mr . wright was not in , and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant that miriam was waving in the air .	98.1455
miriam now ordered pengally to break down the gate , but he said he really couldn ' t go that far .	33.764717
at this point mrs . frances cupply , one of wright ' s handsome daughters by his first wife , came from the house and tried to calm miriam as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane on another sign with a rock .	52.68552
miriam noel wright said , `` here i am at my own home , locked out so i must stand in the road ' ' ! !	38.297714
then she rounded on weston and cried , `` you always did wright ' s dirty work ! !	45.96914
when i take over taliesin , the first thing i ' ll do is fire you ' ' .	33.635555
`` madame noel , i think you had better go ' ' , said mrs . cupply .	31.965046
`` and i think you had better leave ' ' , replied miriam .	12.787515
turning to the reporters , she asked , `` did you hear her ? ?	61.621994
' i think you had better leave ' ! !	60.19125
and this is my own home ' ' .	1.506683
in the silence that followed , miriam walked close to mrs . cupply , who drew back a step on her side of the gate .	43.114384
then , with staring eyes and lips drawn thin , miriam said to the young woman , `` you are ugly -- uglier than you used to be , and you were always very ugly .	46.25659
you are even uglier than mr . wright ' ' .	2.8703194
the animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force	20.02254
and it gave miriam noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art .	127.24673
as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him	39.406815
she also went to washington and appealed to senator george william norris of nebraska , the fighting liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard .	105.52495
then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , miriam gave a ghastly echo of mrs . micawber by suddenly stating , `` i will never leave mr . wright ' ' .	30.182617
under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers .	35.396347
miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can feel the generalized anger in wright ' s remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole .	42.750286
first , wright said , he was choked by the smoke , which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town .	37.911896
`` that isn ' t a boulevard , it ' s a racetrack ' ' ! !	7.697637
cried wright , showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the 1920 ' s .	34.24067
`` this is a horrible way to live ' ' , wright went on .	27.170132
`` you are being strangled by traffic ' ' .	1.2766502
he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty , and began to talk trenchant sense , though private anguish showed through in the vehemence of his manner .	100.7345
`` take a gigantic knife and sweep it over the loop ' ' , wright said .	15.567752
`` cut off every building at the seventh floor .	10.943237
if you cut down these horrible buildings you ' ll have no more traffic jams .	20.212755
you ' ll have some joy in the life of this city .	44.802242
after all , that ' s the job of the architect -- to give the world a little joy ' ' .	37.02432
little enough joy was afforded wright in the spring of 1925 , when another destructive fire broke out at taliesin .	53.20251
the first news stories had it that this blaze was started by a bolt of lightning , as though miriam could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of the old testament .	52.55387
a storm did take place that night , and fortunately enough , it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames .	55.26879
later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting the fire	206.67316
at any rate , heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it melted the window panes , and fused the k ' ang-si pottery to cinders .	17.138435
wright set his loss at $200 , 000 , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined , and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed .	26.7644
in spite of the disaster , wright completed during this period plans for the lake tahoe resort , in which he suggested the shapes of american indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm , that came to nothing .	51.734917
amid a shortage of profitable work , the memory of albert johnson ' s $20 , 000 stood out in lonely grandeur -- the money had quickly melted away .	54.998642
a series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time	148.33752
and the question before these meetings was , here is a man of international reputation and proved earning power	89.37336
how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ? ?	23.11765
while this was under consideration , dauntless as ever wright set about the building of taliesin 3 .	197.45459
as he made plans for the new taliesin , wright also got on paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation of all faiths , and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping ramp .	49.33709
years were to pass before these plans came off the paper , and wright was justified in thinking , as the projects failed , that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to taliesin .	78.93029
and now there was some question as to his continued residence there .	143.50565
billy koch , who had once worked for wright as a chauffeur , gave a deposition for miriam ' s use that he had seen olgivanna living at taliesin .	56.534256
this might put wright in such a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin	114.720406
nor was she moved by a letter from wright pointing out that if he was not `` compelled to spend money on useless lawyer ' s bills , useless hotel bills , and useless doctor ' s bills ' ' , he could more quickly provide miriam with a suitable home either in los angeles or paris , as she preferred .	48.05335
miriam sniffed at this , and complained that wright had said unkind things about her to reporters .	63.803947
his reply was , `` everything that has been printed derogatory to you , purporting to have come from me , was a betrayal , and nothing yet has been printed which i have sanctioned ' ' .	40.355076
what irritated miriam was that wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made , which he considered she would accept `` when she tires of publicity ' ' .	74.72656
from her california headquarters , miriam fired back , `` i shall never divorce mr . wright , to permit him to marry olga milanoff ' ' .	21.071922
then miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending , and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty , with the understanding that wright would not contest it .	53.230904
the bank of wisconsin sent a representative to the judge ' s chambers in madison to give information on wright ' s ability to meet the terms .	40.299686
he said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could be brought to an end , and that the bank would accept a mortgage on taliesin to help bring this about .	63.14583
miriam said that she must be assured that `` that other woman , olga , will not be in luxury while i am scraping along ' ' .	39.507915
this exhausted wright ' s patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel suite .	76.315575
`` volstead laws , speed laws , divorce laws ' ' , he said , `` as they now stand , demoralize the individual , make liars and law breakers of us in one way or another , and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd .	36.922337
if mrs . wright doesn ' t accept the terms in the morning , i ' ll go either to tokyo or to holland , to do what i can .	48.23824
i realize , in taking this stand , just what it means to me and mine ' ' .	29.926668
here wright gave a slight sigh of weariness , and continued , `` it means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as i best can for myself and those dependent upon me ' ' .	83.3333
next day , word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce	38.688637
his mentioning of japan and holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking .	24.00942
no matter what troubles might betide him , this most american of artists knew in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land .	345.89432
in a few weeks miriam made another sortie at taliesin , but was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates .	20.963833
more likely , you simply told yourself , as you handed us the book , that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation .	54.928455
for pride ' s sake , i will not say that the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into my soul .	16.272617
besides , that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood .	67.47227
but what you could not know , of course , was how smoothly the victorian fitzgerald was to lead into an american fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come , if not of age , then into a bright , taut semblance of it .	57.47969
i do not suppose you ever heard of f . scott fitzgerald , living or dead , and moreover i do not suppose that , even if you had , his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval .	60.593864
neither his appetites , his exacerbations , nor his despair were kin to yours .	8.266172
he might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him .	152.44458
but he was no man in the moon to me .	12.189676
although his tender nights were not the ones i dreamed of , nor was it for yachts , sports cars , tall drinks , and swimming pools , nor yet for money or what money buys that i burned , i too was burning and watching myself burn .	100.83532
the flame was simply of a different kind .	6.3605084
it was symbolized ( at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image ) by that self-consuming , elegiac candle of edna st . vincent millay ' s , that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a beacon to us , but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral taper to last even the evening , let alone the night .	46.9218
one should not , of course , pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume to linger on .	46.525547
yet this passion for passion , now that i look back on it with passion spent , seems somewhat overblown and operatic , though as a diva miss millay perfectly controlled her notes .	81.93805
only what else was she singing but the old song of songs , that most ancient of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves ? ?	96.970985
perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us , temporarily anyway , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest ? ?	56.568718
one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend	66.42184
one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul .	37.564796
but it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum .	31.65393
one could see this chemical determinant as in itself a miracle .	70.55119
in any case , miss millay ' s sweet-throated bitterness , her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love , her constant and wonderfully tragic posture , so unlike that of fitzgerald since it required no scenery or props , drew from the me that i was when i fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea .	92.64038
but all this , i am well aware , is the bel canto of love , and although i have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that i listened , i know well enough that it was not .	33.048466
if i am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of love , i will have to stop trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale .	29.883228
there is another side of love , more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie , or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug .	28.49862
whether you experienced the passion of desire i have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have i wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one ' s mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one ' s parents ' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger .	52.672318
at the same time , i am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox if one hates , they say it is because one loves	36.006947
if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid	127.516304
if one shuns , they say it is because one desires	90.51309
and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite .	64.53331
well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ?	79.01223
) , i have never wanted to know what you knew of passion .	68.60602
you probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as i , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the farm .	88.261986
we had been walking quite briskly , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your stride in those days could easily match mine .	175.8476
we had stopped before a shop window to assess its autumnal display , when you suddenly turned to me , looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats , and with your nervous `` ahem ' ' ! !	27.494307
said `` there are things i must tell you about this man you are marrying which he does not know himself ' ' .	52.35712
if you had screamed right there in the street where we stood , i could not have felt more fear .	69.97974
with scarcely a mumble of excuse , i fled .	15.423868
i fled , however , not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom -- in the sense you meant the word `` things ' ' -- which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which i had already insisted upon finding out for myself ( despite , i may now say , the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle , yes , on principle , and in cold blood ) because i was resolved , as a modern woman , not to be a mollycoddle waiting for life but to seize life by the throat .	73.32124
i had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal .	18.834908
what i fled from was my fear of what , unwittingly , you might betray , without meaning to , about my father and yourself .	72.185196
but i can see from this latest trick of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it is than the will .	233.58144
while my memory holds with relentless tenacity , as i cannot too often stress , to my wrongs , when it comes to my shames , it gestures and jokes and toys with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from them .	34.377415
just as i was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside of the leaf of love , memory , displeased at being asked to yield its unsavory secrets , dashed ahead of me , calling back over its shoulder `` skip it .	66.94292
but i will not skip it or cut it out .	35.28703
it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings of chance .	54.89486
if to be innocent is to be helpless , then i had been -- as are we all -- helpless at the start .	168.66322
but the time came when i was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless .	44.987495
helpless in that sense i can never be again .	109.772705
however , i confess my hope that i will be innocent again , not with a pristine , accidental innocence , but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone .	56.717247
for innocence , of all the graces of the spirit , is i believe the one most to be prayed for .	79.11074
although it is constantly made to look foolish ( too simple to come in out of the rain , people say , who have found in the innocent an impediment ) , it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks .	64.00647
it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best , and when they seem worst it overlooks them .	48.910496
to innocence , a word given is a word that will be kept .	48.439705
instinctively , innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by .	36.928207
but when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust , innocence can falter , since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it .	89.53699
the innocence of which i speak is , i know , not incorruptible .	44.439106
but i insist upon believing that even when it is lost , it may , like paradise , be regained .	25.12617
however , it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking , but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love .	86.06755
here , if anywhere , it is not wholly incontrovertible .	8.913003
to you , for instance , the word innocence , in this connotation , probably retained its biblical , or should i say technical sense , and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear by saying that i lost -- or rather handed over -- what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before i was legally entitled , and in fact by oath required , to hand it over along with what other goods and bads i had .	98.53813
but to me innocence is far less tangible .	9.956637
i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my trust in you , but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved , through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing , nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking , let alone with love .	116.98111
i knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time i acquired it	35.061005
today , these many years later , after all the temptations resisted or yielded to , the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured , i call it corrupting still .	34.74968
you , i could swear to it , remained innocent in this sense until the end .	192.95113
yours , but not mine , was an age in which innocence was fostered and carefully -- if not perhaps altogether innocently -- preserved .	61.93487
you had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across her face .	28.077782
moreover , because of the particular blot on your family escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your grandmother ' s part , and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle bed of your childhood to outgrow , what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person , what you bent your whole will , sensibility , and intelligence upon , was to be a lady .	70.06892
before being daughter , wife , or mother , before being cultured ( a word now bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen bestowed on it ) , before being sorry for the poor , progressive about public health , and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian , indeed first and foremost , you were a lady .	101.78812
there was , of course , more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind ' s eye than the sine qua non of her virtue .	43.65796
a lady , you made clear to me both by precept and example , never raised her voice or slumped in her chair , never failed in social tact ( in heaven , for instance , would not mention st . john the baptist ' s head ) , never pouted or withdrew or scandalized in company , never reminded others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture , never indulged in public scenes or private confidences , never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering , never gossiped or maligned , never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself .	69.82697
the songs sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments .	90.44553
often these listeners would refer sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties .	20.657112
in due time sandburg was a walking thesaurus of american folk music .	24.639668
after he had finished the first two volumes of his lincoln , sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him .	57.208523
he rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists .	21.79583
the result was a collection of 280 songs , ballads , ditties , brought together from all regions of america , more than one hundred never before published the american songbag .	37.223827
each song or ditty was prefaced by an author ' s note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had , musical arrangement , and most of the chorus and verses .	51.45747
the book , published in 1927 , has been selling steadily ever since .	60.44136
as sandburg said at the time `` it is as ancient as the medieval european ballads brought to the appalachian mountains , it is as modern as skyscrapers , the volstead act , and the latest oil well gusher ' ' .	27.398989
sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer .	2.2402413
first , carl respects his audience and prepares his speeches carefully .	17.315737
even when he is called upon for impromptu remarks , he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes .	26.779541
he has his own system of shorthand , devised by abbreviations `` humility ' ' will be `` humly ' ' , `` with ' ' will be `` w ' ' , and `` that ' ' will be `` tt ' ' .	13.491265
the second reason for his popularity is his complete spontaneity with the guitar .	19.036255
it is a mistake , however , to imagine that sandburg uses the guitar as a prop .	41.722248
he is no dextrous-fingered college boy but rather a dedicated , humble , and bashful apostle of this instrument .	18.785955
at age seventy-four , he became what he shyly terms a `` pupil ' ' of andres segovia , the great guitarist of the western world .	17.68665
it is not easy to become segovia ' s pupil .	8.956446
`` his fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help in disciplining them .	36.468727
i found that this precocious , grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be taught .	18.597538
there has long existed a brotherly affection between us , thus i accepted him as my pupil .	75.12904
just as in the case of every prodigy child , we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to show up in the future -- if he should master all the strenuous exercises i inflicted on him .	69.10751
to play the guitar as he aspires will devour his three-fold energy as a historian , a poet and a singer .	19.72324
one cause of schopenhauer ' s pessimism was the fact that he failed to learn the guitar .	25.556597
i am certain that carl sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy .	69.11842
the heart of this great poet constantly bubbles forth a generous joy of life -- with or without the guitar ' ' .	41.85061
the public ' s identification of carl sandburg and the guitar is no happenstance .	21.69107
he is proud of having segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him titled `` the guitar ' ' .	19.808935
carl says it is the greatest poem ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem to that subtle instrument .	40.904316
`` a portable companion always ready to go where you go -- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant -- to be shared with few or many -- just two of you in sweet meditation ' ' .	56.689476
the new york herald tribune ' s photographer , ira rosenberg , tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a picture of carl playing a guitar .	15.53835
mr . rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one .	133.96246
`` preferably ' ' , said carl , `` one battered and worn , such as might be found in a pawnshop ' ' .	54.40887
they went to the pawnshop of joseph miller of 1162 sixth avenue .	9.837508
`` mr . miller was in the shop ' ' , the herald tribune story related , `` but was reluctant to have anybody ' s picture taken inside , because his business was too ' confidential ' for pictures .	60.21189
`` but after introductions he asked ' carl sandburg ? ?	8.954539
`` he wanted mr . sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had displayed behind glass in the center of his shop , but the poet eyed this somewhat distastefully .	22.22581
' kalamazoo guitars ' , he said , ' used by radio hillbilly singers .	251.05713
`` he chose one from mr . miller ' s window , a plain guitar with no fancy polish .	33.144005
while the picture was taken , mr . miller ' s disposition to be generous to mr . sandburg increased to the point where he advised , ' i won ' t even charge you the one dollar rental fee ' ' ' .	59.781506
when someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to be a celebrity , carl said , `` a celebrity is a fellow who eats celery with celerity ' ' .	19.324331
this has always been carl ' s attitude .	8.539858
lloyd lewis wrote that when he first knew carl in 1916 , sandburg was making $27 . 50 a week writing features for the day book and eating sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants .	33.324276
he walked home at night for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley .	32.528664
when fame came it changed sandburg only slightly .	26.44594
lewis remembered another newspaperman asking , `` carl , have your ideas changed any since you got all these comforts ' ' ? ?	104.824844
carl thought the question over slowly and answered `` i know a starving man who is fed never remembers all the pangs of his starvation , i know that ' ' .	36.15975
that was all he said , lewis reports .	29.872046
in answer to a new york times query on what is fame ( `` thoughts on fame ' ' , october 23 , 1960 ) , carl said `` fame is a figment of a pigment .	36.287266
another is a bubble of a bauble ' ' .	1.3909589
`` ah , did you once see shelley plain ' ' ? ?	15.289479
the impression you get from carl sandburg ' s home is one of laughter and happiness	19.84991
and the laughter and the happiness are even more pronounced when no company is present .	70.97547
carl has been married to paula for fifty-three years , and he has not made a single major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion with his wife .	81.26497
through all these years , mrs . sandburg has pointedly avoided the limelight .	10.007034
she has shared her husband ' s greatness , but only within the confines of their home	29.036922
it is a dedication which began the moment she met carl .	184.69673
mrs . sandburg received a phi beta kappa key from the university of chicago and she was busy writing and teaching when she met sandburg .	64.61617
`` you are the ' peoples ' poet ' ' ' was her appraisal in 1908 , and she stopped teaching and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of her husband ' s career .	18.41177
she has rarely been photographed with him and , except for carl ' s seventy-fifth anniversary celebration in chicago in 1953 , she has not attended the dozens of banquets , functions , public appearances , and dinners honoring him -- all of this upon her insistence .	49.217552
even now i will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts .	320.65622
the only way to describe paula sandburg is to say she is beautiful in a grecian sense .	51.514206
her clothes , her hair , everything about her is both graceful and simple .	60.917496
she has small , broad , capable hands and an enormous energy .	60.370586
she is not only a trained mathematician and classicist , but a good architect .	14.657121
she designed and supervised the building of the harbert , michigan , house , most of which was constructed by one local carpenter who carried the heavy beams singly upon his shoulder .	35.566544
as the sandburg goat herd increased , she also designed the barn alterations to accommodate them .	11.953772
when erosion threatened the foundation of their home in harbert , paula sandburg planted grapevines and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the sands away .	46.50593
she was born lilian steichen , her parents immigrants from luxemburg .	6.896243
her mother called her paus ' l , a luxemburg endearment meaning `` pussycat ' ' .	9.570129
some of the children of the family could not pronounce this name and called her paula , a soubriquet carl liked so much she has been paula ever since .	76.97738
her parents , pious roman catholics , christened her mary anne elizabeth magdalene steichen .	8.101485
`` my mother read a book right after i was born and there was a lilian in the book she loved and i became lilian -- and eventually i became paula ' ' .	48.422604
this family of luxemburg immigrants , in fact , produced two exceptional children .	61.422424
paula ' s older brother is edward steichen , a talented artist and , for the past half-century , one of the world ' s eminent photographers .	24.265617
( two years ago the photography editor of vogue magazine titled his article about steichen , `` the world ' s greatest photographer ' ' .	18.552513
by the time lilian had been graduated from public school , her parents were doing quite well .	56.415527
her mother was a good manager and established a millinery business in milwaukee .	14.396932
but her father was not enthusiastic about sending young paula to high school .	120.02335
`` this is no place for a young girl ' ' , he said .	5.3423176
the parents compromised , however , on a convent school and paula went to ursuline academy in london , ontario .	34.75938
she was pious , too , once kneeling through the night from holy thursday to good friday , despite the protest of the nuns that this was too much for a young girl .	42.734203
she knelt out of reverence for having read the meditations of st . augustine .	6.9203444
she read everything else she could get her hands on , including an article ( she thinks it was in the atlantic monthly ) by mark twain on `` white slavery ' ' .	71.897316
paula was saddened about what was happening to little girls and vowed to kneel no more in chapel .	66.90226
if there was ever a thought in her mind she might devote her life to religion , it was now dispelled .	83.707016
`` i felt that i must devote myself to the ' outside ' world ' ' .	40.167427
she passed the entrance examinations to the university of illinois , but during the year at urbana felt more important events transpired at the university of chicago .	31.201216
`` and besides , thorstein veblen was one of the chicago professors ' ' .	18.672245
at the university of chicago she studied whitman and shelley , and became a socialist .	22.042944
socialist leaders in milwaukee recognized her worth , not only because of her dedication but because of her fluency in german , french , and luxemburg .	27.1196
she once gave a german recitation before a convention of german-language teachers in milwaukee .	27.561651
carl and paula met in milwaukee in 1907 during paula ' s christmas holiday visit to her parents .	44.738102
he `` legitimized ' ' paula for lilian steichen , and it was paula who insisted on carl for charles .	68.41177
victor berger , the panjandrum of wisconsin socialism and member of congress , had asked paula steichen to translate some of his german editorials into english .	85.55603
carl , who was stationed in appleton , wisconsin , organizing for the social democrats , was in berger ' s office and made it his business to escort paula to the streetcar .	46.732727
she left the next day for her teaching job at princeton , illinois .	30.179558
( after graduation from the university of chicago , paula taught for two years in the normal school at valley city , north dakota , then two years at princeton ( illinois ) township high school .	38.123886
) by the time the streetcar pulled away , he had fallen in love with paula .	34.67832
paula says that even though carl ' s letters usually began , `` dear miss steichen ' ' , there was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband and wife .	45.03324
paula generously lent me one of carl ' s love letters , dated february 21 , 1908 , hotel athearn , oshkosh , wisconsin	19.784481
`` dear miss steichen it is a very good letter you send me -- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare i am carrying on up here .	39.739407
never until in this work of s-d organization have i realized and felt the attitude and experience of a teacher .	121.72414
the united states is always ready to participate with the soviet union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice .	60.922466
certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the united states has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation	25.771637
by the same token , we reject any soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force or subversion .	75.56633
now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort .	67.93408
not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries	37.82238
we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them .	61.325527
we and our friends are , of course , concerned with self-defense .	35.26613
growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the free world have a great stake in the progress , in freedom , of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations .	21.081757
these peoples , desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels of living must not , by our neglect , be forced to seek help from , and finally become virtual satellites of , those who proclaim their hostility to freedom .	98.020485
but they must have technical and investment assistance .	4.700102
this is a problem to be solved not by america alone , but also by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help .	104.82974
in recent years america ' s partners and friends in western europe and japan have made great economic progress .	63.31292
the international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the early postwar years .	48.655293
no longer is the united states the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries .	89.42796
to remain secure and prosperous themselves , wealthy nations must extend the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope , confidence , and progress .	41.110947
a rich nation can for a time , without noticeable damage to itself , pursue a course of self-indulgence , making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens -- thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nations .	65.03436
but the enmities it will incur , the isolation into which it will descend , and the internal moral and spiritual softness that will be engendered , will , in the long term , bring it to economic and political disaster .	52.42017
america did not become great through softness and self-indulgence .	1.6269021
her miraculous progress in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy and substantial adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious philosophy	154.12892
the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her own best interests .	105.36552
to us and to every nation of the free world , rich or poor , these qualities are necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater security , prosperity and peace .	105.10543
i believe that the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing nations to achieve progress .	8.805564
the immediate need for this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation ' s international balance of payments .	37.451477
our surplus from foreign business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas , to finance private investment , and to provide assistance to the less developed nations .	46.860947
in 1959 our deficit in balance of payments approached four billion dollars .	157.0933
continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would , over time , impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world .	55.489662
we must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world trade .	63.20972
further , we must induce all industrialized nations of the free world to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate .	28.208199
this co-operation in this matter will provide both for the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further increases in mutually profitable trade .	122.897804
new nations , and others struggling with the problems of development , will progress only -- regardless of any outside help -- if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it .	84.80398
moreover , progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned	123.70058
there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane .	17.649025
but , just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years , so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination deserve help .	197.25255
respecting their need , one of the major focal points of our concern is the south-asian region .	19.819376
here , in two nations alone , are almost five hundred million people , all working , and working hard , to raise their standards , and in doing so , to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty .	56.808758
i cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that , in our own and free world interest , we must co-operate with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions , as expressed in their different multi-year plans .	51.734818
through the world bank and other instrumentalities , as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help , we must squarely face this titanic challenge .	59.711304
i shall continue to urge the american people , in the interests of their own security , prosperity and peace , to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully supported .	52.09804
free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom .	85.91805
other countries , some of which i visited last month , have similar needs .	243.75493
a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort .	34.0946
during the past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western nations .	40.951443
because of its wealth of experience , the organization for european economic cooperation could help with the initial studies needed .	95.55695
the goal is to enlist all available economic resources in the industrialized free world , especially private investment capital .	79.016975
by extending this help , we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom ' s banner .	103.00308
no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined .	11.032988
if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic advancement , we will make brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom .	67.53352
otherwise , the outlook could be dark indeed .	4.8851748
we face , indeed , what may be a turning point in history , and we must act decisively and wisely .	56.820465
as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength .	102.748344
no matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace , we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction .	52.132084
until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions .	62.3984
it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support .	119.20954
it is world-wide knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack the united states by surprise , even though we might sustain great losses , would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction .	72.146645
but i once again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states , except in defense , will never turn loose this destructive power .	84.00383
during the past year , our long-range striking power , unmatched today in manned bombers , has taken on new strength as the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory .	26.07786
in fourteen recent test launchings , at ranges of five thousand miles , atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target .	38.43289
this is less than the length of a jet runway -- well within the circle of destruction .	55.19218
incidentally , there was an atlas firing last night .	12.2366905
from all reports so far received , its performance conformed to the high standards i have just described .	32.93621
such performance is a great tribute to american scientists and engineers , who in the past five years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles , where america had none before .	65.501816
this year , moreover , growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will enter our active forces , some to be armed with polaris missiles .	36.383774
these remarkable ships and weapons , ranging the oceans , will be capable of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth .	58.08956
to meet situations of less than general nuclear war , we continue to maintain our carrier forces , our many service units abroad , our always ready army strategic forces and marine corps divisions , and the civilian components .	50.807323
the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process .	150.00401
it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength .	82.31697
the deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores , on land and sea , is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security .	52.47464
moreover , i have directed that steps be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to these allies .	61.08108
this is necessary for a sounder collective defense system .	24.606522
next i refer to our program in space exploration , which is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research and development .	16.337296
we note that , first , america has already made great contributions in the past two years to the world ' s fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science .	31.776299
these discoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community	42.740135
but they are important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind .	43.202557
second , our military missile program , going forward so successfully , does not suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engines , which are necessary in distant space exploration .	43.180687
i am assured by experts that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements .	28.687803
third , the united states is pressing forward in the development of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space for exploration purposes .	37.57874
fourth , in the meantime , it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth .	31.498764
using launch systems presently available , we are developing satellites to scout the world ' s weather	19.846102
satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the globe	8.598939
for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and aircraft	98.29003
and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the data we seek .	71.31788
fifth , we have just completed a year ' s experience with our new space law .	74.10368
suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly .	158.17569
the accomplishment of the many tasks i have alluded to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual , intellectual , and economic sinews of american life .	25.869022
the steady purpose of our society is to assure justice , before god , for every individual .	239.47382
we must be ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the issues of the day .	14.542794
a year ago , when i met with you , the nation was emerging from an economic downturn , even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful .	42.925915
today our surging strength is apparent to everyone .	5.108059
1960 promises to be the most prosperous year in our history .	10.295135
yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders .	24.952671
among current problems that require solutions , participated in by citizens as well as government , are	102.69965
the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged labor-management stalemate	38.969288
the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture	21.390482
the continuing threat of inflation , together with the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility	17.660398
in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law .	92.970825
the group , upon the issuance of its first press release on december 21 , 1957 , designated itself a `` committee of investigation ' ' .	30.959284
in the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven witnesses .	86.29271
it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer , adolf a . berle , jr . , once .	19.717707
its second press release was on january 15 , 1958 , and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed .	14.518672
it also implied that paul bang-jensen had been irresponsible .	10.346605
on january 18 , ernest gross conducted a press conference at the u . n . lasting an hour .	14.259451
here , he openly attacked bang-jensen and referred to his `` aberrant conduct ' ' .	4.37702
this conference was held despite stavropoulos ' assurance to adolf berle , who was leaving the same day for puerto rico , that nothing would be done until his return on january 22 , except that the secretary general would probably order the list destroyed .	54.58405
on january 24 paul bang-jensen , accompanied by adolf berle , was met by dragoslav protitch and colonel frank begley , former police chief of farmington , conn . , and now head of u . n . special police .	14.701677
the four , bundled in overcoats , mounted to the wind-swept roof of the u . n .	9.24859
there , begley lit a fire in a wire basket , and bang-jensen dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames .	27.237577
in one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eighty-one refugees .	7.9621334
the method of destroying the evidence embarrassed paul bang-jensen .	5.221889
he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence .	30.286497
he was right , and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordier ' s words on the subject , `` well , it seemed as good a place as any to do the job ' ' .	44.97749
the gross group had been formed for the express purpose of advising the secretary general .	67.18826
hammarskjold ' s supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of ernest gross is illusion , at best .	88.60819
gross ' s , being `` outside ' ' the u . n . applied only to a physical state , not an objective one .	42.684647
but by the time the papers were finally disposed of , the group had informed the world of its purpose , its recommendations , and its belief that paul bang-jensen was not of sound mind .	85.83742
shortly the group would issue its report to the secretary general , recommending paul bang-jensen ' s dismissal from the united nations .	26.095448
the contents of this 195-page document would become known to many before it would become known to the man it was written about .	97.88886
`` until this hungarian committee matter came up , bang-jensen was a fine and devoted individual .	82.898964
i had known him for some years , when i was a delegate and before , and this manner had never been his ' ' .	56.636925
ernest a . gross leaned back in his chair and told peter marshall how secretary general dag hammarskjold had , on december 4 , 1957 , called him in as a private lawyer to review bang-jensen ' s conduct `` relating to his association with the special committee on the problem of hungary ' ' .	57.270916
the result was the `` gross report ' ' , prepared by gross , as chairman , with the assistance of two u . n . under secretaries , constantin stavropoulos and philippe de seynes .	17.267262
`` yes ' ' , gross went on , `` bang-jensen was an up-and-coming young man .	36.475063
never well known , but he had done his work competently .	40.75368
gross had received marshall courteously and they were discussing the case .	14.424459
`` you know ' ' , the lawyer said , `` it ' s difficult to talk like this about a man who can ' t answer back ' ' .	18.796408
gross was behind a clean-top desk , only a manila folder before him .	13.582641
marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs .	10.951907
outside the office windows , twenty-four stories above wall street , a light rain was falling .	73.2326
`` mr . gross , your report says that ' our function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate from or prejudice mr . bang-jensen ' s rights as a staff member .	66.028175
you know , bang-jensen characterized your committee as having prejudged his case ' ' .	36.76616
`` well , how could that have been ? ?	76.75431
i don ' t consider that he was prejudged .	7.054289
we were given a job and we carried it out , and later , his case was taken up by the disciplinary committee .	32.08583
`` we have nothing to hide under a bushel .	8.173758
we did our job , mr . stavropoulos and mr . de seynes and myself , taking evidence from a number of people ' ' .	30.939318
`` what did you think about his mental state ' ' ? ?	38.560783
`` i think our report sums up our finding ' ' , gross answered .	17.529993
`` don ' t forget , here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report .	20.23741
`` this was not merely alleging errors , but was carried out by day-after-day allegations in memos , written charges of serious consequence .	25.858412
supposing you or i were being accused in this manner , and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work .	79.58744
`` i ' ve been in government and i can tell some pretty hairy stories about personnel difficulties , so i know what a problem he was ' ' .	77.21177
`` what i ' d like you to comment on is the criticism leveled at your committee ' ' .	87.12216
`` what do you mean ' ' ? ?	1.0190225
`` for instance , regarding the fact that the gross committee issued two interim announcements to the press during its investigation .	152.77736
you know bang-jensen was told the committee was ' to convey its views , suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general .	38.22777
in his own words , bang-jensen ' took it for granted that the group would report to the secretary general privately and not in public .	94.41355
he claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was ' prejudicial to his position ' ' ' .	35.038284
for an instant he glared speechless at marshall .	10.992825
`` i thought the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end .	27.885435
but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press .	40.8688
it was getting so that we , the committee , were being tried .	488.45227
you can find it in the papers ' ' .	1.7940412
`` well , as a matter of fact , i ' ve looked through back-issue files of new york papers for december , 1957 , and haven ' t found a great deal ' ' --	29.759003
`` it wasn ' t necessarily all here in new york .	16.177689
don ' t forget the foreign press ' ' .	1.337685
`` then what about the second interim public announcement ? ?	67.49937
this cited bang-jensen ' s ' aberrant conduct ' ' ' .	14.67677
`` the reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list .	38.28739
as far as i ' m concerned , it was a separate matter from the general committee study of bang-jensen ' s conduct .	66.14055
the january fifteen report recommended that bang-jensen be instructed to burn the list -- the papers -- in the presence of a u . n . security officer ' ' .	26.994492
`` how about your press conference three days later -- what was the reason for that ? ?	37.555744
bang-jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance to make sure the term ' aberrant conduct ' was not libelous .	29.647154
he claimed you made other slanderous allegations ' ' .	1.3524412
`` the entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list , since many in the press were querying the u . n . about it .	27.691433
bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession .	37.529438
`` it was foolish of him to keep them , whatever they were .	84.09485
he could have been blackmailed , or his family might have been threatened .	57.741295
of course the matter caught the public ' s attention .	8.842396
we attempted to conclude this , and did so by having the papers burned .	173.4822
hammarskjold didn ' t like the way it was carried out .	9.508838
hammarskjold believes the u . n . is an organization that settles matters in a procedural way .	34.35456
if hammarskjold had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner , and if bang-jensen had not wanted it -- who had ordered it ? ?	68.11336
`` mr . gross , concerning the formation of your committee , there ' s the fact that you have been a legal adviser to the u . n . in the past	21.429441
as i understand it , mr . hammarskjold wanted outside advice .	552.6946
could you comment on that ' ' ? ?	1.0123721
`` i ' ve served as a counsel for the u . n . for some years , specializing particularly in real estate matters or other problems that the regular u . n . legal staff might not be equipped to handle .	40.31833
mr . stavropoulos is the u . n . legal chief and a very good man , but he is not fully versed on some technical points of american law ' ' .	35.044365
`` what did you think about bang-jensen ' s contention of errors and omissions in the hungarian report ' ' ? ?	27.30757
`` why , mick shann went over and over the report with alsing andersen , trying to check them out .	36.373684
even after the incident between bang-jensen and shann in the delegates ' lounge and this was not the way the chicago tribune presented it ' ' .	33.158566
gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings .	56.75639
one was an article on the u . n . by alice widener from the cincinnati enquirer .	18.293758
the other was by chesly manley in the chicago daily tribune .	34.99379
`` i know ches , he ' s a friend of mine .	12.5856285
he probably didn ' t mean to write it this way , or maybe he did .	79.73642
there wasn ' t any ' violent argument ' between bang-jensen and shann , as the tribune puts it .	51.789192
that implies that shann was on the enemy side .	3.2877655
how it ' s phrased there -- the word violent .	54.341084
`` the case was that bang-jensen came up to shann claiming he had found further errors in the report .	57.424976
' i ' ve found errors and i want you to look them over .	75.42931
so once again shann had to argue with him about this .	60.294262
but it wasn ' t a violent discussion .	3.316591
and after all this , shann went over all that bang-jensen had brought up ' ' .	41.142807
( shann ' s own report , peter marshall reflected , describes the encounter as `` immoderate ' ' .	6.5166364
bang-jensen was in `` hysterical condition ' ' .	3.3714855
it was a good report , he did all he could to make it a good report .	56.67396
when i speak of how shann felt , i know well .	149.49048
don ' t forget , i am an old member of the club , a former delegate .	31.758816
i think you are being unfair to take these things up now .	113.92186
`` you know , this hits in many areas .	19.948393
it appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the hungarian situation .	13.997417
don ' t forget , the u . n . did no more than the united states did .	43.586555
it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact ' ' .	23.894154
from the home of his friend , henrik kauffmann , in washington , d . c . , paul bang-jensen sent a telegram dated december 9 , 1957 , to ernest gross .	11.706364
`` the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character , and i therefore respectfully request that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that i might make adequate preparation ' ' .	38.12077
ernest gross replied the next day , putting the suspended diplomat ' s fears to rest .	16.830896
`` this reveals some misunderstanding on your part .	33.096214
the group conducting the review is not holding formal hearings .	18.20377
it wished to pursue , in the course of this review , questions arising from the body of material already in its possession .	85.69048
it sounded like a fair enough invitation , peter marshall reflected , and bang-jensen must have thought so too , because on the thirteenth , he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth floor of the u . n . .	41.524696
`` we were requested by the secretary general , as i understand it , to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant , and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the secretariat .	39.6159
the only rules which i think we shall follow will be those of common sense , justice , and fairness ' ' .	39.538692
peter marshall noted that bang-jensen had later referred to his two interviews with the gross group as `` unfortunate experiences ' ' , and after his second meeting on the sixteenth the dane refused to attend further hearings without legal counsel .	44.383144
marshall pondered the reason for this , and pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group .	39.56109
j . a . c . robertson , after serving gross one week , left for england .	96.01602
fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged .	3.166886
another week passed and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage .	10.5515995
the sickness was gone and , after all , the two young couples were on their honeymoon .	27.180054
in spite of pickering dodge ' s explicit instructions regarding variation of meals , the food did not seem the same as at home .	61.33567
`` everything tasted differently from what it does on land and those things i was most fond of at home , i loathed the most here ' ' , ann noted .	54.19914
at last they concluded that the heavy , full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise .	92.554504
walking was the remedy , they decided , but a deck full of chicken coops and pigpens was hardly suitable .	57.528988
a rope was found and , like children in school , the missionaries skipped for hours at a time .	47.806133
finally , tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise , they decided to dance instead .	61.76111
it was much more fun , reminding the girls of their old carefree days in the hasseltine frolics room at bradford .	35.135246
the weather turned warmer and with it came better appetites , although harriet was still a little off-color .	40.386955
she could not face coffee or tea without milk , and was always craving types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship .	40.723534
by now she was sure she was going to have a baby , deciding it would be born in india or burma that november .	53.960632
she was more excited than frightened at the prospect of having her first child in a foreign land .	54.611168
the crew of the caravan never failed to amaze ann , who during her stay in salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language .	142.03166
she wrote in her journal , `` i have not heard the least profane language since i have been on board the vessel .	75.62083
she was now enjoying the voyage very much .	5.5637736
even the first wave of homesickness had passed , although there were moments when captain heard pointed out on his compass the direction of bradford that she felt a little twinge at her heart .	57.757126
as for adoniram , she found him to be `` the kindest ' ' of husbands .	11.174741
on sundays , with the permission of captain heard , who usually attended with two of his officers , services were held in the double cabin .	67.20976
sometimes a ship would be sighted and the caravan pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck .	82.82946
captain heard did not communicate with any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united states and britain .	24.304022
as warmer temperatures were encountered ann and harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt water .	24.128489
when may came the caravan had already crossed the equator .	14.087941
they were sailing round the cape of good hope	1695.7755
at this time harriet wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother	186.71283
`` i care not how soon we reach calcutta , and are placed in a still room , with a bowl of milk and a loaf of indian bread .	33.556297
i can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming , oh , what a luxury .	40.429047
i have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel , and the almost intolerable smell after the rain , that i have done little more than lounge on the bed for several days .	34.780163
but i have been blest with excellent spirits , and to-day have been running about the deck , and dancing in our room for exercise , as well as ever ' ' .	31.261976
while studying at the seminary in andover , adoniram had been working on a new testament translation from the original greek .	30.583261
he had brought it along to continue during the voyage .	9.49332
there was one particular word that troubled his conscience .	45.074028
this was the greek word most often translated as `` baptism ' ' .	4.3807316
born a congregationalist , he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops of water sprinkled on his head , yet nowhere in the whole of the new testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized by sprinkling .	48.325634
john the baptist used total immersion in the river jordan for believers	32.42912
the more adoniram looked at the greek word for baptism , the more unhappy he became over its true meaning .	104.31733
as was only natural he confided his searchings to ann , conceding ruefully that it certainly looked as if their own congregationalists were wrong and the baptists right .	36.484756
by this time she had learned that it was futile to argue with her young husband , yet the uncomfortable fact remained the american congregationalists were sending them as missionaries to the far east and paying their salaries .	47.92526
what would happen if adoniram `` changed horses in midstream ' ' ? ?	4.4938946
baptists and congregationalists in new england were on friendly terms .	37.689156
how embarrassing it would be if the newly appointed congregationalist missionaries should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace baptist teachings ! !	28.202652
`` if you become a baptist , i will not ' ' , ann informed her husband , but sweeping her threat aside adoniram continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he found himself .	77.66754
by early june they were a hundred miles off the coast of ceylon , by which time all four missionaries were hardened seafarers .	51.991863
even harriet could boldly write , `` i know not how it is	34.74432
and the waves threatening to swallow up the vessel	55.928043
ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two strange tropical birds .	23.804369
land was near , and on june 12 , one hundred and fourteen days after leaving america , they actually saw , twenty miles away , the coast of orissa .	70.59649
captain heard gave orders for the ship to be anchored in the bay of bengal until he could obtain the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters .	29.472696
sometimes ships waited for days for such a man , but captain heard was lucky .	51.228153
next day a ship arrived with an english pilot , his leadsman , an english youth , and the first hindu the judsons and newells had ever seen .	24.0971
a little man with a `` a dark copper color ' ' skin , he was wearing `` calico trousers and a white cotton short gown ' ' .	27.391523
`` he looks as feminine as you can imagine ' ' , she decided .	24.10811
all day long the caravan slowly made her way through the difficult passages .	149.50458
alas , to ann ' s consternation , his language while thus employed left much to be desired .	411.44342
he swore so loudly at the top of his voice , that she didn ' t get any sleep all the next night .	37.80563
next morning the caravan was out of the treacherous bay .	11.318862
relieved of the major part of his responsibility for the safety of the ship , the pilot ' s oaths became fewer .	55.147224
slowly she moved up the hooghli river , a mouth of the mighty ganges , toward calcutta .	23.31807
ann was entranced with the view , as were her husband and friends .	62.949604
running across the deck , which was empty now that the livestock had been killed and eaten , they sniffed the spice-laden breezes that came from the shore , each pointing out new and exciting wonders to the other .	39.563084
out came the journal and in it went ann ' s own description of the scene	98.342064
`` on each side of the hoogli , where we are now sailing , are the hindoo cottages , as thick together as the houses in our seaports .	25.440369
they are very small , and in the form of haystacks , without either chimney or windows .	26.567867
they are situated in the midst of trees , which hang over them , and appear truly romantick .	27.14136
the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green , and herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river , and the natives are scattered about differently employed .	37.125996
some are fishing , some driving the team , and many are sitting indolently on the banks of the river .	16.042805
the pagodas we have passed are much larger than the houses ' ' .	10.99677
where were the hardships she had expected ? ?	1.0535766
she was certain now that it would be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home in the big white house in haverhill .	99.359245
with childlike innocence she wrote of the indians as `` walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands , with the tawny children around them .	49.917934
this is the most delightful trial i have ever had ' ' , she decided .	22.616161
the indians who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly , even if she was suitably shocked , according to the customs of the society in which she had been reared , to find them `` naked , except a piece of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle ' ' .	52.32466
at last they saw calcutta , largest city of bengal and the caravan ' s destination .	6.003321
founded august 24 , 1690 by job charnock of the east india company , and commonly called `` the city of palaces ' ' , it seemed a vast and elegant place to ann hasseltine judson .	38.793472
solid brick buildings painted dazzling white , large domes and tall , picturesque palms stretched as far as the eye could see , while the wharves and harbor were filled with tall-masted sailing ships .	21.104256
crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their strange-sounding bengali tongue .	6.850889
harriet ' s mouth watered with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last to her much-craved milk and fresh bread .	68.22095
ann , pleased to see her friend happy , was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of captain heard had sent on board for their enjoyment .	46.905537
cautiously she sampled her first pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of `` a rich pear ' ' .	19.096819
though she did not then know its name , this strange new fruit was a banana .	41.265667
the first act of adoniram and samuel on reaching calcutta was to report at the police station , a necessity when landing in east india company territory .	98.36781
on the way they tried to discover all they could about burma , and they were disturbed to find that michael symes ' s book had not presented an altogether true picture .	62.459187
he had failed to realize that the burmese were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself .	83.35949
they were in fact quietly laughing at him , for their king wished to have nothing to do with the western world .	56.476162
when captain john gibault of salem had visited burma in 1793 his ship , the astra , had been promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the irrawaddy river .	21.646921
although after much trouble he did manage to get it back , he discovered there was no trade to be had .	115.8387
all captain gibault took back to salem were a few items for the town ' s east india museum .	54.82828
a year later another salem ship returned from burma with a cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy .	20.468288
after that salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly burma .	2.333433
the burmese appeared to have little knowledge of british power or any idea of trade .	99.49004
cruel burmese governors could , on the slightest whim , take a man ' s life .	18.259619
as for missionaries , even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the christian faith to the burmans .	29.692123
unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate .	26.268297
`` go back to america or any other place ' ' , well-meaning friends of captain heard advised them , `` but put thoughts of going to burma out of your heads ' ' .	44.621098
somewhat daunted , the two american missionaries reached the police station where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk .	46.510475
when he discovered they had received from the company ' s court of directors no permission to live in india , coupled with the fact that they were americans who had been sent to asia to convert `` the heathen ' ' , he became more belligerent than ever .	33.75569
they explained that they desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could be found .	57.69739
she describes , first , the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by this `` unseasonable exultation ' '	8.4923935
he is answered by a confused , honest englishman .	37.586353
the reasons for the whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government , their delight at the prospect of a new war , their hopes of having the tories hanged , and so on .	34.0725
as for the author of the englishman , mrs . manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the protestant cause should be left to `` ridpath , dick steele , and their associates , with the apostles of young man ' s coffee-house ' ' .	28.996187
another controversy typical of the war between the englishman and the examiner centered on robert ( later viscount ) molesworth , a whig leader in ireland and a member of the irish privy council .	18.109648
on december 21 , the day that the irish house of commons petitioned for removal of sir constantine phipps , their tory lord chancellor , molesworth reportedly made this remark on the defense of phipps by convocation `` they that have turned the world upside down , are come hither also ' ' .	36.554367
upon complaints from the lower house of convocation to the house of lords , he was removed from the privy council , his remark having been represented as a blasphemous affront to the clergy .	24.58476
steele , who had earlier praised molesworth in tatler no . 189 , now defended him in englishman no . 46 , depicting his removal as a setback to the constitution .	37.158707
on the other hand , molesworth was naturally assailed in the tory press .	18.916384
swift , in the dublin edition of a preface to the bishop of sarum ' s introduction , indicated his feelings by including molesworth , along with toland , tindal , and collins , in the group of those who , like burnet , are engaged in attacking all convocations of the clergy .	19.458614
in the same way he coupled molesworth and wharton in a letter to archbishop king , and he had earlier described him as `` the worst of them ' ' in some `` observations ' ' on the irish privy council submitted to oxford .	26.264145
a month later , in the publick spirit of the whigs , he used steele ' s defense of molesworth as evidence of his disrespect for the clergy , calling steele ' s position an affront to the `` whole convocation of ireland ' ' .	21.989702
on this issue , then , as on so many in these months , steele and swift took rigidly opposed points of view .	82.00661
in the early months of 1714 , the battle between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its major phase .	65.95672
the preliminaries ended with the publication of steele ' s crisis on january 19 , and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace .	59.14081
in answer to the crisis , swift produced the publick spirit of the whigs , his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend .	31.344595
by this time , as we shall see , the tories were already planning to `` punish ' ' steele for his political writing by expelling him from the house of commons .	34.478622
despite his defense of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech before the house , their efforts were successful .	43.664017
steele lost his seat in parliament , and his personal quarrel with swift , by now a public issue , thus reached its climax .	61.34111
of all the whig tracts written in support of the succession , the crisis is perhaps the most significant .	33.07092
certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate .	12.601518
hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation , said to have reached 40 , 000 , and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other government writers , the work must have had considerable impact .	77.44931
steele ' s main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a stuart restoration .	18.863672
to this end , the first and longest section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the revolution to defend england against the `` arbitrary power of a popish prince ' ' .	42.48247
in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes of current whig propaganda , ranging from a criticism of the tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough	47.477684
but his principal theme is that the intrigues of the tories , `` our popish or jacobite party ' ' , pose an immediate threat to church and state .	16.833082
like burnet , he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis .	20.751102
treasonable books striking at the hanoverian succession , he complains , are allowed to pass unnoticed .	17.789993
in this connection , swift , too , is drawn in for attack `` the author of the conduct of the allies has dared to drop insinuations about altering the succession ' ' .	33.44367
in his effort to stir the public from its lethargy , steele goes so far as to list catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected in the event of a stuart restoration , and , with rousing rhetoric , he asserts that the only preservation from these `` terrours ' ' is to be found in the laws he has so tediously cited .	36.762177
`` it is no time ' ' , he writes , `` to talk with hints and innuendos , but openly and honestly to profess our sentiments before our enemies have compleated and put their designs in execution against us ' ' .	25.940563
steele apparently professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his own good , since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the house .	56.096924
in the final issues of the englishman , which ended just as the new session of parliament began , he provided his enemies with still more ammunition .	113.59644
for example , no . 56 printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of duke of cambridge .	43.838264
in a few months the duke was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant succession .	15.619224
at the order of the dowager electress , the hanoverian agents , supported by the whig leaders , demanded that a writ of summons be issued which would call the duke to england to sit in parliament , thus further insuring the succession by establishing a hanoverian prince in england before the queen ' s death .	26.737173
anne was furious , and bolingbroke advised that the request be refused .	316.53806
oxford , realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ , took the opposite view , for which the queen never forgave him .	40.673523
accordingly the request was granted , but the elector himself , who had not been consulted by his mother , rejected the proposal and recalled his agent schutz , whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the hanoverian interest to suffer and had made oxford ' s dismissal more likely than ever .	41.099728
steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan .	69.49828
a few days after this englishman appeared , defoe reported to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the duke be called over	77.33406
defoe then commented , `` if they could draw that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves quickly , for they are not asham ' d to say they want only a head to make a beginning ' ' .	109.631996
the final issue of the englishman , no . 57 for february 15 , ran to some length and was printed as a separate pamphlet , entitled the englishman being the close of the paper so-called .	71.53643
steele ' s purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which had occupied him in the englishman	40.38439
but there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift .	47.238934
thus he complains , with considerable justice , that the tory writers have resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments .	30.593273
his birth , education , and fortune , he says , have all been ridiculed simply because he has spoken with the freedom of an englishman , and he assures the reader that `` whoever talks with me , is speaking to a gentleman born ' ' .	36.758945
as notable examples of this abuse , he quotes passages from the examiner , `` that destroyer of all things ' ' , and the character of richard steele , which he here attributes to swift .	34.26734
though put in rather maudlin terms , steele ' s defense of himself has a reasonable basis .	61.224167
his point is simply that the tories have showered him with personal satire , despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of the sovereign .	41.877148
he claims , too , that his political convictions are simply those which are called `` revolution principles ' ' and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties .	53.794724
the final section of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of steele ' s relations with swift .	34.92455
it purports to be a letter from steele to a friend at court , who , in miss blanchard ' s opinion , could only be meant as swift .	52.461517
steele first answers briefly the charges which his `` dear old friend ' ' has made about his pamphlet on dunkirk and his crisis .	34.35528
then he launches into an attack on the tory ministers , whom he calls the `` new converts ' '	27.353214
by this term he means to ridicule their professions of acting in the interest of the church despite their own education and manner of life -- a gibe , in other words , at the `` presbyterianism ' ' in harley ' s family and at bolingbroke ' s reputed impiety .	23.215607
the tory leaders , he insinuates , are cynically using the church as a political `` by-word ' ' to increase party friction and keep themselves in power .	59.628963
this is the principal point made in this final section of englishman no . 57 , and it caps steele ' s efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the notion of the tories as a `` church party ' ' supported by the body of the clergy .	31.406326
next , steele turns his attention to the `` courtier ' ' he is addressing .	9.046313
he explains that there are sometimes honorable courtiers , but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not hesitate to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own avarice and ambition .	50.317917
such , he implies , is the case with his friend , who is not really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts .	43.99822
if `` jack the courtier ' ' is really to be taken as swift , the following remark is obviously steele ' s comment on swift ' s change of parties and its effect on their friendship `` i assure you , dear jack , when i first found out such an allay in you , as makes you of so malleable a constitution , that you may be worked into any form an artificer pleases , i foresaw i should not enjoy your favour much longer ' ' .	69.418594
he closes his `` letter ' ' by demanding that dunkirk be demolished , that the pretender be forced to move farther away from the coast of england , and that the queen and the house of hanover come to a better understanding .	50.179222
the last point was soon to be included in the `` seditious ' ' remarks used against him in parliament .	20.470352
the examiner , during steele ' s trial a month later , printed an answer from the `` courtier ' ' addressed to `` r . s . ' ' at button ' s coffee-house .	26.431927
he reviews steele ' s entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly should be credited to the indulgence of his friends .	59.340385
once more , in other words , steele is said to be indebted to swift for his `` wit ' '	58.0291
this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared in the tory press , especially the examiner .	28.881592
in the publick spirit of the whigs , it may be noted , swift himself contemptuously dismissed steele ' s reference to his friend at court `` i suppose by the style of old friend , and the like , it must be some body there of his own level	60.804108
among whom , his party have indeed more friends than i could wish ' ' .	35.7912
on february 16 , steele took his seat in parliament .	14.196045
by now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from tory papers and pamphlets , and action was being taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from parliament .	72.216965
on the very day that the parliamentary session began , another `` infamous libel ' ' appeared , entitled a letter from the facetious dr . andrew tripe , at bath , to the venerable nestor ironside .	17.861338
it is filled with the usual personal abuse of steele , especially of his physical appearance	50.607773
in the opening paragraph , too , steele is accused of extreme egotism , of giving `` himself the preference to all the learned , his contemporaries , from dr . swift himself , even down to poet cr--spe of the customhouse ' ' .	52.079723
when harold arlen returned to california in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with johnny mercer , begun some years before .	49.584732
the film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled out of this world , a satire on the sinatra bobby-soxer craze .	34.44546
the twist lay in using bing crosby ' s voice on the sound track while leading man eddie bracken mouthed the words .	39.466244
if nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , `` out of this world ' ' and `` june comes around every year ' ' .	48.77359
though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on .	91.687744
early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled hot nocturne .	71.007225
it purported to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians , their aims , their problems -- the tug-of-war between the `` pure ' ' and the `` commercial ' ' -- and seemed a promising vehicle , for the two men shared a common interest in jazz .	44.648434
johnny mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears .	18.395193
he was born in savannah , georgia , in 1909 .	9.047172
his father , george a . mercer , was descended from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one hugh mercer , who had emigrated from scotland in 1747 .	49.10545
the lyricist ' s father was a lawyer who had branched out into real estate .	22.957247
his second wife , lillian , was the mother of john h . mercer .	47.001453
by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the call .	19.208641
one day he followed the irish jasper greens , the town band , to a picnic and spent the entire day listening , while his family spent the day looking .	74.720856
the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy .	64.5922
both were obviously on the way to the mercer home .	407.0987
the mother inquired , `` where ' s johnny , and why did you leave him ' ' ? ?	29.573395
`` there was nothing else i could do ' ' , the maid answered , satisfied with a rather vague explanation .	43.290424
the maid then told her , `` because he fired me ' ' .	16.427364
with her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music -- though she waited until he was ten -- beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet .	102.9857
young mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments .	89.58656
still , he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the woodberry forest school , near orange , virginia , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well .	39.079468
when he was fifteen john h . mercer turned out his first song , a jazzy little thing he called `` sister susie , strut your stuff ' ' .	21.724384
if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been , mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect .	50.637657
from his playmates in savannah , mercer had picked up , along with a soft southern dialect , traces also of the gullah dialects of africa .	26.615814
such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language .	9.96269
during the summers , while he was still in school , mercer worked for his father ' s firm as a messenger boy .	48.402924
it generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer ' s help .	90.21909
`` we ' d give him things to deliver , letters , checks , deeds and things like that ' ' , remembers his half-brother walter , still in the real estate business in savannah , `` and learn days later that he ' d absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket .	50.118515
this rather detached attitude toward life ' s encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in mercer ' s personality ever since .	42.35562
it is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not only has mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure .	75.94675
he has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp businessman .	78.287346
in 1927 his father ' s business collapsed , and , rather than go bankrupt , mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation .	101.73876
he died before he could completely pay off his debts .	5.243019
some years later the bank handling the mercer liquidation received a check for $300 , 000 , enough to clear up the debt .	47.2983
the check had been mailed from chicago , the envelope bore no return address , and the check was not signed .	62.282707
`` that ' s johnny ' ' , sighed the bank president , `` the best-hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded ' ' .	25.688372
but mercer ' s explanation was simple `` i made out the check and carried it around a few days unsigned -- in case i lost it ' ' .	71.65695
when he remembered that he might have not signed the check , mercer made out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other -- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly signed both of them .	62.740555
when the family business failed , mercer left school and on his mother ' s urging -- for she hoped that he would become an actor -- he joined a local little theater group .	86.59865
when the troupe traveled to new york to participate in a one-act-play competition -- and won -- mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in new york .	47.187885
he had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to savannah .	133.04012
but mercer hung on , living , after a fashion , in a greenwich village fourth-flight walk-up .	24.015009
`` the place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub ' ' , his mother discovered when she visited him .	28.060617
`` johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor -- he ' s always been a good cook -- and i ' ll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub ' ' .	32.539772
a story , no doubt apocryphal , for mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monacle in those village days .	55.829166
though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers .	40.9385
one day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle and broke it .	61.76305
the innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle -- and did , over the protests of the former owner -- with a square monacle .	130.63666
mercer is supposed to have refused it with , `` anyone who wears a square monacle must be affected ' ' ! !	64.59085
everett miller , then assistant director for the garrick gaieties , a theatre guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written	28.575788
he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however .	28.756506
for him mercer produced the lyric to `` out of breath scared to death of you ' ' , introduced in that most successful of all the gaieties , by sterling holloway .	56.723602
this 1930 edition also had songs in it by vernon duke and ira gershwin , by e . y . harburg and duke , and by harry myers .	29.911797
entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song writer to take a wife , elizabeth meehan , a dancer in the gaieties .	23.244984
the mercers took up residence in brooklyn , and mercer found a regular job in wall street `` misplacing stocks and bonds ' ' .	26.250128
when he heard that paul whiteman was looking for singers to replace the rhythm boys , mercer applied and got the job , `` not for my voice , i ' m sure , but because i could write songs and material generally ' ' .	50.107105
while with the whiteman band mercer met jerry arlen .	3.0155306
he had yet to meet harold arlen , for although they had `` collaborated ' ' on `` satan ' s li ' l lamb ' ' , mercer and harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them .	31.55839
the lyric , mercer remembers , was tailored to fit the unusual melody .	36.864334
mercer ' s whiteman association brought him into contact with hoagy carmichael , whose `` snowball ' ' mercer relyriced as `` lazybones ' ' , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of mercer ' s song-writing career .	20.994333
after leaving whiteman , mercer joined the benny goodman band as a vocalist .	12.952244
with the help of ziggy elman , also in the band , he transformed a traditional jewish melody into a popular song , `` and the angels sing ' ' .	33.92036
the countrywide success of `` lazybones ' ' and `` and the angels sing ' ' could only lead to hollywood , where , besides harold arlen , mercer collaborated with harry warren , jimmy van heusen , richard whiting , walter donaldson , jerome kern , and arthur schwartz .	18.802118
mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs .	16.379862
he may be the only song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the u . s . treasury	9.030289
he collaborated on a song with william hartman woodin , who was secretary of the treasury , 1932-33 .	5.941331
when johnny mercer and harold arlen began their collaboration in 1940 , mercer , like arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them `` hooray for hollywood ' ' , `` ride , tenderfoot , ride ' ' , `` have you got any castles , baby ? ?	45.02925
' ' , and `` too marvelous for words ' ' ( all with richard whiting )	62.222683
with harry warren he did `` the girl friend of the whirling dervish ' ' , `` jeepers creepers ' ' , and `` you must have been a beautiful baby ' ' .	8.258918
mercer ' s lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances , a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair .	13.834495
though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with the best of them , mercer ' s forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit .	24.507359
his casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in absentia , were an abrupt change from harburg ' s , so that arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration .	49.96175
there were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously .	58.521748
speaking of his work with johnny mercer , arlen says , `` our working habits were strange .	47.15338
after we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked out , we ' d get together for an hour or so every day .	70.18552
while johnny made himself comfortable on the couch , i ' d play the tunes for him .	46.43853
after i would finish playing the songs , he ' d just go away without a comment .	82.70692
i wouldn ' t hear from him for a couple of weeks , then he ' d come around with the completed lyric ' ' .	21.656094
arlen is one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer mercer has been able to work with so closely , for they held their meetings in arlen ' s study .	47.48493
`` some guys bothered me ' ' , mercer has said .	45.209465
`` i couldn ' t write with them in the same room with me , but i could with harold .	47.687748
he often uses very odd rhythms , which makes it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer ' ' .	28.294659
while arlen and mercer collaborated on hot nocturne , mercer worked also with arthur schwartz on another film , navy blues .	67.65274
arlen , too , worked on other projects at the same time with old friend ted koehler .	23.955605
besides doing a single song , `` when the sun comes out ' ' , they worked on the ambitious american-negro suite , for voices and piano , as well as songs for films .	33.436245
the american-negro suite is in a sense an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection of negro songs , not for a night club , but for the concert stage .	67.44666
the work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which koehler set the words `` there ' ll be no more work	67.28964
there ' ll be no more worry ' ' , matching the spiritual feeling of the jot .	19.011745
this grew into the song `` big time comin ' ' ' .	3.6517072
by september 1940 the suite had developed into a collection of six songs , `` four spirituals , a dream , and a lullaby ' ' .	15.594168
the negro composer hall johnson studied the american-negro suite and said of it , `` of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a negroid idiom in both words and music , these six songs by harold arlen and ted koehler easily stand far out above the rest .	78.545265
thoroughly modern in treatment , they are at the same time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average ' broadway spirituals ' which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the ' amen corner ' , ' judgement day , ' gabriel ' s horn , and a frustrated devil -- with a few random hallelujahs thrown in for good measure .	81.658195
it had a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards .	7.7887096
it was here that the terror-stricken dennis moon played an unrehearsed role during the children ' s party .	44.354362
a much larger room , adjacent to the lavatory , served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet .	17.203848
that unused room was large enough for -- well , say an elephant could get into it and , as a matter of fact , an elephant did .	50.732697
something occurred on the morning of the children ' s party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused us .	74.84949
it so happened that sports writer arthur robinson got out of the hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he be back in an hour or two to continue his convalescence .	137.80661
arthur robinson traveled with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the american .	71.74831
he was ghost writer for babe ruth , whose main talent for literary composition was the signing of his autograph .	25.726055
robbie was a war veteran with battle-shattered knees .	6.871561
he arrived on crutches at the newspaper club with one of his great pals , oliver herford , artist , author , and foe of stupidity .	22.664164
mr . herford ' s appearance was that of a frustrated gnome .	17.022974
he seemed timid ( at first , ) wore nose glasses from which a black ribbon dangled , and was no bigger than a jockey .	26.728199
robinson asked herford to escort him to the club ' s lavatory before they sat down for a highball and a game of cards .	25.217184
in the jakes , after robbie and his crutches were properly stowed , mr . herford went to the adjoining facility .	11.449203
he had barely assumed his stance there when a fat fellow charged through the doorway .	62.60473
without any regard for rest-room protocol , the hulking stranger almost knocked herford off his pins .	85.85944
the artist-author said nothing , but stood to one side .	42.457657
the unrelieved stranger eventually turned away from the place of his -- shall we dare say his waterloo ? ?	76.933815
mr . herford touched the fat man ' s arm .	3.0693867
may i say that you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb -- the younger pliny ' s , if memory serves me -- which , translated freely from the archaic latin , says , ' the more haste , the less peed ' ' ' .	46.89754
governor alfred e . smith was the official host at the children ' s party .	68.76299
united states senator royal s . copeland was wearing the robes of santa claus and a great white beard	30.038965
the honorable robert wagner , sr . , at that time a justice of the new york supreme court , was on the reception committee .	50.006737
i was in charge of the arrangements -- which were soon enough disarranged .	57.971046
i had had difficulties from the very first day .	35.601707
when , in my enthusiasm , i proposed the party , my city editor ( who disliked the club and many of its members ) tried to block my participation in the gala event .	82.36719
even earlier than that he had resented the fact that i had been chosen to edit the club ' s reporter .	27.810038
city editor victor watson of the new york american was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious shifts of mood .	38.343945
mr . hearst ' s telegraphic code word for victor watson was `` fatboy ' ' .	6.859293
the staff saw in him the qualities of a don cossack , hence , as mentioned before , his nickname `` the hetman ' ' .	40.49813
the hetman ' s physical aspects were not those of a savage rider of the steppes .	24.793459
indeed , he looked more like a well-fleshed lay brother of the hospice of st . bernard .	58.342613
he had a purring voice and poker player ' s immobility of features which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the bodies were buried .	29.755228
he was the son of a scottish father and an american jewish mother , long widowed , with whom he lived in a comfortable home in flushing .	36.043106
he had worked in the newspaper business since he was nineteen years old , always for the hearst service .	60.393936
from the very first he regarded himself as mr . hearst ' s disciple , defender , and afterward his prime minister , self-ordained .	17.38547
it was said that the hetman plotted to take over the entire hearst newspaper empire one day by means of various coups the destruction of editors who tried to halt his course , the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to mr . hearst .	48.900604
whatever the hetman ' s ambitions , his colleagues were kept ill at ease .	55.33179
among the outstanding members of the hearst cabinet whom he successfully opposed for a time were the great arthur brisbane , bradford merrill , s . s . carvalho , and colonel van hamm .	54.6688
he also disliked runyon , for no good reason other than the fact that the demon ' s talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the hetman ' s say-so or his supervision .	52.89541
runyon , for his part , had a contemptuous regard for mr . watson .	62.248623
`` he ' s a wrong-o ' ' , said runyon , `` and i wouldn ' t trust him as far as i could throw the statue of liberty ' ' .	24.030102
arthur `` bugs ' ' baer wrote to me just recently , `` vic wanted to die in harness , with his head towards the wagon .	43.778534
he supported his mother and his brother , who afterwards committed suicide .	65.6183
watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother , blossoms bought with vic ' s allowance to him .	31.207504
' and would you believe it ' , vic added , ' she likes him better than she does me .	70.296684
about the only time the hetman seemed excited was when one of his own pet ideas was born .	73.61292
then he would get to his feet , as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers , and say almost invariably , `` gentlemen , this is an amazing story ! !	96.82429
it ' s bigger than the armistice ' ' .	1.4706589
some of the hetman ' s `` ideas ' ' were dream-ridden , vaguely imparted , and at times preposterous .	8.115102
one day he assigned me to lay bare a `` plot ' ' by the duponts to supply munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur in cuba .	46.98757
he said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip .	28.964092
`` i can tell you this much ' ' , he said .	2.7585266
it ' s bigger than the armistice ' ' .	1.4706589
i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own well-informed sources .	123.63659
then i spent the next two days at the baseball park and at jack doyle ' s pool parlors .	34.266956
when i returned to make my report , the hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission .	53.283688
he was busy , he said , in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation .	103.366104
and i was to go to work on that odd matter .	468.8945
the hetman had a strong liking for a story , any story which was to be had by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods .	91.39708
most of my stories were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me the facts , and not as a rule by playing clever tricks .	82.09338
one day i tired of following the hetman ' s advice of `` shadowing ' ' and of the `` ring-around-the-rosie ' ' approach to a report that enrico caruso had pinched a lady ' s hip while visiting the central park monkey house .	30.35683
i explained my state of mind to artist winsor mccay and to `` bugs ' ' baer .	9.90972
mr . baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the friars .	18.041435
we fashioned beards , put them on , and reported to the hetman at the city desk .	32.24702
mr . baer had an auburn beard , like longfellow ' s .	12.319161
mr . mccay had on a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache .	8.970314
as for myself , i had on an enormous black `` muff ' ' .	24.25531
this , together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglasses , gave me the appearance of a russian nihilist .	17.557453
`` we are ready for your next mysterious assignment ' ' , said mr . baer to the hetman .	14.7530575
`` where to , sir ' ' ? ?	1.0252831
mr . watson did not have much humor in his make-up , but he managed a mirthless smile .	11.707617
just then a reporter telephoned in from the bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder .	61.148777
the hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it .	27.239338
while i was sitting at one of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard , arthur brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand .	39.68314
he paused for a moment to look at me , then went on to the city desk to deliver his `` today ' ' column .	52.66971
i thought it expedient to take off my derby , my glasses , and the beard	10.838685
i managed to do this by the time the great a . b . returned to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist .	170.97424
he stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk .	9.118835
then he wrinkled his huge brow and went slowly out of the room .	14.316312
he had been `` seeing things ' ' .	6.2929573
the hetman ' s `` ideas ' ' for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless or lacking in merit .	98.02623
he campaigned successfully for the riddance of `` death avenue ' ' and also brought about the ending of pollution of metropolitan beaches by sewage .	43.607605
he exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters , nat ferber and carl helm .	71.19465
in the conduct of these and many other campaigns , the hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed .	71.429
it seems to me now , in a long backward glance , that many of the hetman ' s conceits and odd actions -- together with his grim posture when brandishing the hatchet in the name of mr . hearst -- were keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day .	29.507795
alone , rejected on every hand , divorced , and in financial trouble , he leaped from an eleventh-floor window of the abbey hotel in 1937 .	44.85734
one finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol , w . r . hearst .	58.7606
that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair .	91.158646
the unfinished note , written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope , and addressed to the coroner , makes one wonder about many things `` god forgive me for everything .	74.1937
much to damon runyon ' s amazement , as well as my own , i got along splendidly with the hetman	47.230194
that is , until i became an editor , hence , in his eyes , a rival .	36.436005
not long after colonel van hamm had foisted me on the watson staff i received a salary raise and a contract on the hetman ' s recommendation .	46.008644
during the next years he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the hearst service .	107.8339
it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists .	34.770863
i would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement .	36.223362
somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he otherwise might have because his foe , colonel van hamm , wouldn ' t touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil .	40.416496
i remember one day when mr . hearst ( and i never knew why he liked me , either ) sent the hetman a telegram `` please find some more reporters like that young man from denver ' ' .	83.68168
watson showed this wire to colonel van hamm .	12.099586
the colonel grunted , then made a remark which might be construed in either of two ways .	107.35758
`` don ' t bother to look any further .	109.04067
we already have the only one of its kind ' ' .	34.16228
the hetman did have friends , but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession .	18.905048
sergeant mike donaldson , congressional medal of honor soldier , was one of them .	27.056793
dr . menas s . gregory was another .	107.4844
i used to go with watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment , to sit among the doctor ' s excellent collection of statues , paintings , and books and drink oriental coffee while watson seemed to thaw out and become almost affable .	38.011646
there was one time , however , when his face clouded and he suddenly blurted , `` why did my brother commit suicide ' ' ? ?	24.32753
i cannot remember dr . gregory ' s reply , if , indeed , he made one .	58.446392
if she were not at home , mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there .	71.62334
sometimes , mrs . coolidge would close herself in the green suite on the second floor , and play the piano she had brought to the white house .	34.069485
mama knew she was playing her son ' s favorite pieces and feeling close to him , and did not disturb her .	45.698605
all the rest of the days in the white house would be shadowed by the tragic loss , even though the president tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him .	49.981636
a little boy came to give the president his personal condolences , and the president gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in .	74.13348
backstairs , the maids cried a little over that , and the standing invitation was not mentioned to mrs . coolidge .	39.02876
the president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been before the tragedy .	64.15653
he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips .	28.741241
dresses were short in the days of mrs . coolidge , and spanish shawls were thrown over them .	12.085974
one shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it , so she draped it over the banister on the second floor , and it hung over the stairway .	22.195545
the president used to look at it with a ghost of a smile .	19.611801
mrs . coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection .	102.81961
she kept the dolls on the lincoln bed .	15.083733
at night , when mama would turn back the covers , she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night .	49.721973
mama always felt that the collection symbolized mrs . coolidge ' s wish for a little girl .	14.857069
among the dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady , who would pick it up and look at it often .	69.07878
it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist .	2.3614206
an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for mrs . coolidge ' s first granddaughter .	14.037803
mama knew this doll was meant to help mrs . coolidge overcome her grief by turning her eyes to the future .	24.073647
the name inside the envelope was `` cynthia ' ' .	3.6446226
the coolidges ' life , after the death of their son , was quieter than ever .	23.819704
john was away at school most of the time .	15.847982
mrs . coolidge would knit , and the president would sit reading , or playing with the many pets around them .	124.00963
now and then , the president would call for `` little jack , master of the hounds ' ' , which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the white house since teddy roosevelt ' s administration , and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals .	35.46751
it was part of little jack ' s work to look after the dogs .	53.548267
one white house dog was immortalized in a painting .	12.886196
that was rob roy , who posed with mrs . coolidge for the portrait by howard chandler christy .	33.67613
to get him to pose , mrs . coolidge would feed him candy , so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did .	36.03449
i would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress mrs . coolidge is wearing in this painting .	35.120255
it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian .	24.852104
people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist much later on .	125.521736
the dress in the painting is a bright red , with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side .	20.95902
there is a long train flowing from the shoulders .	10.620031
mrs . coolidge gave mama this dress for me , and i wore it many times .	24.26851
i still have the dress , and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution as a memento , or , as i more fondly hope , to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the presidents -- if i can get it organized .	72.71815
but to get back to the coolidge household , mrs . coolidge so obviously loved dogs , that the public sent her more dogs -- calamity jane , timmy , and blackberry .	30.297974
the last two were a red and a black chow .	9.549617
rob roy remained boss of all the dogs .	8.200168
he showed them what to do , and taught them how to keep the maids around the white house in a state of terror .	40.26473
the dogs would run through the halls after him like a burst of bullets , and all the maids would run for cover .	47.87846
mama didn ' t know what to do -- whether to tell on rob roy or not -- since she had the ear of mrs . coolidge more than the other maids .	46.19753
but she was afraid the first lady would not understand , because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first family .	18.512075
every day , when the president took his nap , rob roy would stretch out on the window seat near him , like a perfect gentleman , and stare thoughtfully out the window , or he would take a little nap himself .	45.18646
he would not make a sound until the president had wakened and left for the office	110.32527
then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear .	115.8054
his signal was for the other dogs to come running , but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch out .	52.405636
rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to his office every morning .	43.02363
rob roy was well aware of the importance of this mission , and he would walk in front of the president , looking neither to the right nor to the left .	47.248417
at dinner , lunch , or breakfast , the president would call out , `` supper ' ' ! !	38.38358
-- he called all meals supper -- after the butler had announced the meal .	21.009352
all the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to the dining room .	16.667006
they would all lie around on the rug during the meal , a very pretty sight as rob roy , prudence , and calamity jane were all snow-white .	23.022018
when prudence and blackberry were too young to be trusted in the dining room , they were tied to the radiator with their leashes , and they would cry .	18.520176
mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the first family returned .	39.687206
finally , mama did mention to mrs . coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs , and then mrs . coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone , even though her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity .	41.34355
mama was now the first maid to mrs . coolidge , because catherine , the previous first maid , had become ill and died .	38.099316
mrs . coolidge chose mama in her place .	27.001804
every first family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship .	148.10316
for the coolidges , it was mr . and mrs . frank w . stearns of boston , massachusetts , owners of a large department store .	18.263405
they seemed to be at the white house half the time .	135.18857
the butlers were amused because when the stearns were there , the president would say grace at breakfast .	113.996574
if the stearns were not there , grace would be omitted .	11.827536
speaking of breakfast , the president inaugurated a new custom -- that of conducting business at the breakfast table .	44.62104
the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part .	97.54755
a new bill had been passed under harding that designated the government , rather than the president , as the tab-lifter for official meals .	30.561321
so the president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government officials to attend .	97.00225
he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate .	61.32898
mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful , mr . coolidge certainly made a good president .	46.278873
he knew exactly how to be colorful ! !	1.0560689
the favorite guest of the house , as far as the staff was concerned , was mr . wrigley , the chewing gum king .	33.074886
the white house had chewing gum until it could chew no more , and every christmas , mr . wrigley sent the president a check for $100 , to be divided among all the help .	54.697563
you can imagine that he got pretty good service .	39.447357
another good friend of the coolidges ' was george b . harvey , who was the ambassador to great britain from 1921 to 1923 .	22.62083
he had been a friend of the hardings , and continued to be invited by the coolidges .	19.071117
the first royalty whom mama ever waited on in the white house was queen marie of rumania , who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 , 1926 .	40.28425
she was not an overnight guest in the white house , but mr . ike hoover , the chief usher , had mama check her fur coat when she came in , and take care of her needs .	44.352318
mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen .	30.563158
mama was very patriotic , and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the white house .	34.140957
actually , two flags were used at the mansion -- a small one on rainy days , and a big one on bright days .	77.65259
the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind , and mama would mend it .	34.715885
she would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening .	43.316338
she used to tell me , `` when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that way , i have the wonderful , safe feeling that americans are protected no matter which way the wind blows ' ' .	76.268936
even when mrs . coolidge was in mourning for her son , she reached out to help other people in trouble .	54.0503
mama had told her how emmett ' s lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the war .	17.63002
he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number of times .	145.22023
taking a personal interest , she had the doctor assigned to the white house , dr . james coupal , look emmett over .	42.881294
as a result , he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the government service .	78.7954
but again , there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the muggy washington weather , and he had to return to the dry climate of the west to live and work .	39.469315
when mrs . coolidge was in mourning , she did not wear black .	57.342674
she wore grey every day , and white every evening .	1420.4167
mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors .	70.445946
the president helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses to get her started .	56.69864
she opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face .	13.397903
on the social side , the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the white house thrilled her the most .	59.842228
it was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs , and , just as the first lady stepped off the last tread , mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the blue room to greet her guests with the president .	30.641254
mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone , and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night .	78.64964
one night , mama came home practically in a state of shock .	19.293358
she had stood at the bottom of the stairs , as usual , when mrs . coolidge came down , in the same dress that is now in the smithsonian , to greet her guests .	23.890718
mama stooped down to fix the train , but there was no train there ! !	78.93044
she reached and reached around the dress , but there was nothing there .	28.429014
she looked up and saw that , without knowing it , mrs . coolidge was holding it aloft .	27.8508
mrs . coolidge looked down , saw mama ' s horrified expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor .	78.87416
mama swirled the train in place , and not a step was lost .	117.16952
the coolidges did not always live at the white house during the presidency .	25.583117
impressive as this enumeration is , it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of jews , collectively or individually , that have been attested by their gentile environment .	48.942047
it is reasonable to affirm two propositions jews have been perceived by non-jews as all things to all men	52.491295
some jews have in fact been all things to all men .	43.72086
in the arena of power jews have at one time or another been somebody ' s ally	123.89821
in the market place jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers , or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors .	46.787525
and so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph .	13.662639
but the two do not invariably or even typically coincide .	26.413443
the `` conventional ' ' image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research .	40.880543
conventional images of jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant images can be both true and false .	102.29068
the genuinely interesting question , then , becomes what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of jews ? ?	50.70449
the working test of `` the facts ' ' must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations .	40.11108
granted , such `` functional ' ' images are subject to human error	88.929115
they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error .	122.32875
in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished current intelligence	64.35397
general grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book	108.89238
if so , he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future .	73.167984
he may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs .	37.35422
predispositions , in turn , fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis .	40.30783
to some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments .	32.881317
in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality .	24.951567
the anti-semitism of hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of lueger ' s politically successful christian socialist movement in vienna .	35.450634
but millions of human beings were exposed to lueger ' s propaganda and record .	15.343032
after allowing for group exposures , it is apparent that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism .	28.773159
they include harmonies and conflicts within the whole man , and mechanisms whereby inner components are more or less smoothly met .	127.426704
modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind .	24.023478
the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or fall short of it .	70.26036
undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality .	36.66008
many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal .	35.59975
undoubtedly , however , the significance of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest .	67.107254
speaking as a non-jew i believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy .	16.734488
since we can neither undo nor redo the past , we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow .	36.736526
in this domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local , national , and world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having some effect , large or small , upon gentile-jewish relations .	125.10782
i am deliberately raising the policy problems involved in gentile-jewish relations .	13.540759
comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method .	59.562523
the tasks are briefly indicated by these questions what are my goals in gentile-jewish relations ? ?	99.554634
what are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized ? ?	29.401419
what factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places ? ?	42.07162
what is the probable course of future developments ? ?	6.778873
what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values ? ?	87.01323
it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range .	131.14163
the discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy .	88.65721
as a groundwork for the proposal i give some attention to the first task enumerated above , the clarification of goal .	45.695717
my reply is that i associate myself with all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity .	38.974842
the basic goal finds partial expression in the universal declaration of human rights , a statement initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many religious and philosophical traditions .	38.782604
within this frame of reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved , as well as upon the nature of the claim , the characteristics of the claimant , the justifications proposed , and the predispositions of the community decision makers who are called upon to act .	40.23755
if jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal , it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship .	48.56538
when decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion .	65.34898
since the recognition of israel as a nation state , claims are made in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body politic .	49.498943
community decision makers must make up their minds whether a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation states .	109.338646
in free countries many controversies involve self-styled jews who use the symbol in asserting a vaguely `` cultural ' ' rather than religious or political identity .	54.440945
the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate to public policy regarding cultural groups .	68.75152
we know that much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that cluster around the key symbol of the jew .	26.976147
many public and private controversies will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in the mind and usage of gentile and jew .	28.570005
however , in the context of legal and civic policy , these controversies are less than novel .	34.57736
they involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any number of non-jewish groups .	27.43332
so far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned , categorical novelties are not to be anticipated in jewish-gentile relationships	41.387577
claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties .	92.646484
it is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched within the public order of the world community or even of free commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving jews and gentiles during coming years .	71.20157
but it is perennially restructured in situations where anchors are dragged or lost .	32.93147
in conformance with the maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relations will be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net advantage , taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration .	65.38296
it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate	67.10226
for instance , imagine the situation if israel ever joins an enemy coalition .	249.97713
the formal position of americans who identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the jewish symbol is already clear	46.95275
the future weight of informal factors cannot be so easily assessed .	49.323505
when we consider the disorganized state of the world community , and the legacy of predispositions adversely directed against all who are identified as jews , it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor and skill .	40.748158
during moments of intense crisis the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming .	32.11428
but their freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which they and the people around them enter the crisis .	66.893845
at such critical moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously `` pay off ' ' .	95.33203
by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality exercise their most sinister impact , with the result that men of good will are often trapped and nullified .	49.468563
among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near the limit of self-control .	43.5586
we are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society	74.54432
a truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best .	143.14241
during intercrisis periods the educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human beings of every age and condition .	28.339115
as more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected .	60.811535
now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach	33.241707
and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good .	26.737238
in any case i do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions .	155.80318
i assume that the number of readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is small , and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others .	79.50987
properly used , the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment .	6.4570575
let us not confuse the issue by labeling the objective or the method `` psychoanalytic ' ' , for this is a well established term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated by sigmund freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered personalities .	48.982872
the traditional method proceeds by the technique of free association , punctuated by interpretations proposed by the psychoanalytic interviewer .	37.677708
what we have in mind does have something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods by which they are sought .	68.5397
for what we propose , however , a psychoanalyst is not necessary , even though one aim is to enable the reader to get beneath his own defenses -- his defenses of himself to himself .	33.34222
for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary	178.31909
but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind .	88.26804
the relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said , whether he responds with anger or applause .	30.653437
self-discovery calls for an open , permissive , inquiring posture of self-observation .	5.706715
the symposium provides an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were addressing definite audiences -- and throughout several hundred pages everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification .	97.37764
an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances within himself , resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around the central figure of the jew .	60.24871
two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time .	88.531456
one , a reservation on the point i have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking , pseudo-feeling , and pseudo-willing , which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom .	31.81879
in essence this involves grounding one ' s thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather than in one ' s own values and experience .	46.312252
there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else .	76.43845
clearly what the person brings to the reading is important .	114.74005
moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking	36.69147
if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity .	36.765682
the second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today .	65.31599
in the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation .	227.70088
the reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different ' ' ? ?	32.651245
and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species .	14.551767
the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else .	106.383995
and this , i think , holds for values as well as life styles .	69.45816
after all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) reader ' s digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character i ever met ' ' deals with village grocers , country doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and so forth .	49.668285
scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too .	54.929214
but still , the proposition is worth examination .	4.5688295
it is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right ' ' and `` wrong ' ' .	21.380983
both flugel and ranyard west deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as niebuhr and buber .	42.872517
it forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy .	127.69238
i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience -- most of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of course , to the influence of religion .	37.097073
still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one ' s ideas of right and wrong	39.294662
certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence .	64.290764
probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available .	55.20774
this is in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of values what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it .	115.15535
in a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .	69.648834
literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose , dedication , mission , significance .	47.08747
this , no doubt , is part of what gilbert seldes implies when he says of the arts , `` they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense ' ' .	72.22093
men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized .	57.80515
feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .	9.856648
a need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so to speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature .	43.51703
the terms `` renewal ' ' and `` refreshed ' ' , which often come up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal ' ' of purpose and a `` refreshed ' ' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction .	40.899174
the notion of `` inspiration ' ' is somehow cognate to this feeling .	39.09161
how literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message ' ' , as well as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose .	47.081375
one of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion .	110.48284
let us differentiate a few of these ideas .	2.988301
the aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , is a persistent and viable one .	21.911316
the idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , plato ' s notion of the arousal of emotion .	44.542454
a third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts , giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals .	51.009983
this is given some expression in beardsley ' s notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision .	20.792053
a fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in housman ' s fine phrase on the arts they `` transform and beautify our inner nature ' ' .	22.147507
it is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea .	38.934265
f . s . c . northrop , in his discussion of the `` functions and future of poetry ' ' , suggests this `` one of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of common-sense objects .	31.512629
if art is to release us from these postulated things ( things we must think symbolically about ) and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these common sense entities ' ' .	40.433575
i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enriched by it .	132.99408
richards ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety for him it constitutes , in part , the organization of impulses .	114.12139
a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these .	36.629143
but there is one in particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention .	39.169586
in the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate .	67.451775
the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way .	83.066414
william wimsatt and cleanth brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected `` for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) -- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at all .	48.771378
something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like `` expressions ' ' of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement ' ' .	39.997257
the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience .	38.889233
here i do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion .	29.0788
i mean something more like freud ' s concept of the utility of `` play ' ' to a small child he plays `` house ' ' or `` doctor ' ' or `` fireman ' ' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control .	28.205723
there is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time .	45.078133
in b . m . spinley ' s portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .	28.880678
perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation .	45.07261
anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean .	108.05048
it is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature .	60.199776
in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with respect to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature ' ' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required .	52.713863
in the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden , or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of words ? ?	43.364212
these are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing .	19.352438
one of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide .	39.01741
sensibility is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill .	56.718918
among other things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences .	49.96586
both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged .	53.205276
its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the english professor with whom one attends the theatre .	29.060287
the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment contrast the perceptual skill of english professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars , political candidates , or female beauty .	96.934044
along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have seen .	73.217896
in a symposium and general exploration of the field of personal perception and interpersonal behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception	54.87586
solomon asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events .	57.906425
but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .	80.42379
i would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what i shall call depth .	76.421394
i use this term to mean three things a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs , a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .	43.971825
it is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia .	8.278701
i think these attributes cluster , but i have no evidence .	39.45011
in fact , i can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .	101.05086
the late r . g . collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote ``	102.15542
we are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with chaucer and cimabue , or even shakespeare and titian .	26.17625
by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and japanese colour-prints	52.126205
but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place .	62.762844
the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else ' ' .	53.82967
one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public , of the newspaper critic , and of the creative artist himself .	40.69634
there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary .	21.483328
the study of ideas in literature is one of these .	11.665709
of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene .	34.524117
the continuities , contrasts , and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other .	84.036285
when we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption .	27.486158
most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or critics , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them .	44.178776
many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding .	34.869835
this understanding , of course , may in its turn take many forms and some of these -- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature -- are essentially historical .	88.84316
but the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , `` texture ' ' , or technique .	15.665414
it is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight .	97.41326
but , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other .	97.84122
at this point a working definition of idea is in order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed .	91.14156
the term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience .	72.48042
it is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .	93.412796
an idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned .	70.79781
in this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so to speak `` writ large ' ' in history of literature where they recur continually .	76.3353
outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries	46.451706
also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man .	8.526217
one might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in so far as it includes the literatures , must center on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning .	42.84619
we need not , to be sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature .	86.28785
an idea , of the sort that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience .	66.23021
thus burns ' s `` my love is like a red , red rose ' ' and hopkins ' `` the thunder-purple sea-beach , plumed purple of thunder ' ' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned .	50.501644
on the other hand , arnold ' s `` the unplumbed , salt , estranging sea ' ' , taken in its context , certainly does so .	46.259205
understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies .	27.779434
thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period .	81.48588
again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways .	101.41802
our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries .	20.742975
very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs to ' ' some way of thought labelled as a `` school ' ' or an `` -ism ' ' , i . e . a complex or `` syndrome ' ' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification .	37.3453
thus ideas like `` grace ' ' , `` salvation ' ' , and `` providence ' ' cluster together in traditional christianity .	25.48506
usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in question , so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` -ism ' ' or mode of thought .	28.152763
accordingly we may speak of the platonism peculiar to shelley ' s poems or the type of stoicism present in henley ' s `` invictus ' ' , and we may find that describing such platonism or such stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise .	43.188705
after all , shelley is no `` orthodox ' ' or hellenic platonist , and even his `` romantic ' ' platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries .	20.89244
again , henley ' s attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like marcus aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost christian , comparable to the patience expressed in milton ' s sonnet on his own blindness .	45.576923
in recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences .	55.59316
when these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even , to some extent , with science .	101.031685
here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian ' s research .	36.583305
let us quote once more from r . g . collingwood `` history is properly concerned with the actions of human beings regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world	60.48824
regarded from the inside , it is the carrying into action of a certain thought the historian ' s business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them .	44.014164
it is a characteristic of thoughts that in re-thinking them we come , ipso facto , to understand why they were thought ' ' .	55.06813
such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition .	24.2329
`` history has this in common with every other science that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in the first place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based .	64.76815
this is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential .	84.96758
the knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events ' ' .	63.820564
it is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research .	109.40028
the student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at the same time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another .	78.89048
let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought -- turning our attention from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades .	81.66886
we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .	55.304176
finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread .	168.15529
no one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them .	38.870457
still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature .	66.36659
the actual moments of contact are vitally important .	8.637116
these moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned .	36.683617
perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the western world has been that of the old and new testament .	38.276043
certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the bible .	59.207203
this reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence .	74.12856
a contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , st . augustine , john bunyan , and thomas jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression .	46.95084
in much the same way , we recognize the importance of shakespeare ' s familarity with plutarch and montaigne , of shelley ' s study of plato ' s dialogues , and of coleridge ' s enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from plato to schelling and william godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of english men of letters .	19.3887
we may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists .	37.430134
english philosopher samuel alexander ' s debt to wordsworth and meredith is a recent interesting example , as also a . n . whitehead ' s understanding of the english romantics , chiefly shelley and wordsworth .	51.394325
hegel ' s profound admiration for the insights of the greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy .	42.564625
again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our minds grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius , who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher empedocles .	46.13833
we must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned , that ideas are `` units ' ' in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even , for that matter , from one individual to another .	80.72528
`` suppose you take mr . hearst ' s morning american at $10 , 000 a year ' ' , brisbane proposed .	52.802544
`` you could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors .	60.30165
if within one year you can make a success out of the american , you can practically name your own salary thereafter .	192.81967
of course , if you don ' t make the american a success , hearst will have no further use for you ' ' .	91.596504
the blue-eyed watson decided that he would dislike living in new york , and the deal fell through .	100.253525
hearst ' s luck was even poorer when he had a chat with franklin k . lane , a prominent california journalist and reform politician , whom he asked for his support .	29.956852
lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of california in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of hearst ' s san francisco examiner .	32.18763
hearst disclaimed blame for this , but the conversation , according to lane , ended on a tart note .	77.55467
`` mr . lane ' ' , hearst said , `` if you ever wish anything that i can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking , and it will be done ' ' .	28.05081
`` mr . hearst ' ' , lane replied as he left , `` if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything , you can put the telegram down as a forgery ' ' .	30.11245
hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to new york to become a father .	18.80969
on april 10 , 1904 , his first child was born , a son named george after the late senator .	46.140686
hearst saw his wife and child , sent a joyful message to his mother in california , and soon returned to washington , where on april 22 , for the first time , he opened his mouth in congress .	35.731686
this was not before the house but before the judiciary committee , where he asked for action on one of his pet bills , that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly .	25.373253
attorney shearn had worked on this for two years and had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the united states attorney for the southern district of new york .	62.491062
hearst had spent more than $60 , 000 of his own money in the probe , but still attorney general knox was quiescent .	38.214214
six of the railroads carrying coal to tidewater from the pennsylvania fields , hearst said , not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines .	45.373837
they had watered their stock at immense profit , then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton , netting themselves another $20 , 000 , 000 in annual profit .	30.554932
`` the attorney general has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months ' ' , hearst said .	43.545673
`` he has not acted in any way , and won ' t let anyone take it away from him .	33.442482
what i want is to have this evidence come before congress and if the attorney general does not report it , as i am very sure he won ' t , as he has refused to do anything of the kind , i then wish that a committee of seven representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence .	72.19063
this was the very sort of legislation that roosevelt himself had in mind .	98.509995
there can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in washington , overt or implied , to block anything hearst wanted , even if it was something good .	70.79389
roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of mckinley .	31.771994
they were repelled by his noisy newspapers , his personal publicity , his presumptuous campaign for the presidential nomination , and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses .	28.93038
he might get votes from his constituents , but he would never get a helping hand in congress .	87.42422
inherently incapable of cooperating with others , he ran his own show regardless of how many party-line democratic toes he stepped on .	102.08043
he was a political maverick , a reformer with his own program , determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him .	29.110168
he showed little interest in measures put forward by the regular democrats .	42.74843
he sought to run congress as he ran his new york american or journal , a scheme veteran legislators resisted .	78.58108
for a freshman congressman to read political lessons to graybeard democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends .	93.17186
he soon quarreled with all the party leaders in the house , and came to be regarded with detestation by regular democrats as a professional radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline .	43.0488
to old-line democrats , the hearst presidential boom , now in full cry , was the joke of the new century .	68.532875
yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant t . r . a semblance of a race .	31.321915
there was talk of dragging old ex-president cleveland out of retirement for another try .	114.08537
some preferred judge alton b . parker of new york .	10.761495
the sneers at hearst changed to concern when it was seen that he had strong support in many parts of the country .	34.154522
platoons of hearst agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful search for delegates at the coming convention , and there were charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading .	56.268837
just when it was needed for the campaign , hearst paper no . 8 , the boston american , began publication .	189.3972
a bay state supporter said , `` mr . hearst ' s fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of his paper in boston ' ' .	40.5776
he ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain from using such words as `` seduction ' ' , `` rape ' ' , `` abortion ' ' , `` criminal assault ' ' and `` born out of wedlock ' ' .	11.486475
in a story headed , `` hearst offers cash ' ' , the republican new york tribune spread the money rumor , quoting an unnamed `` hearst supporter ' ' as saying	23.028622
`` the argument that is cutting most ice is that hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt them if he were elected .	112.744736
the hearst men say that if hearst is nominated , he and his immediate friends will contribute to the democratic national committee the sum of $1 , 500 , 000 .	32.64446
this , it is urged , would relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the trust magnates .	76.89036
the alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds , and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a democratic victory absolutely fruitless .	45.885086
the average democratic politician , especially in the country districts , is hungry for the spoils of office .	34.100536
it has been a long time since he has seen any campaign money , and when the proposition is laid down to him as the friends of mr . hearst are laying it down these days he is quite likely to get aboard the hearst bandwagon ' ' .	55.337936
if anything , the conservative democrats were more opposed to hearst than the republicans .	33.551044
in his own state of new york , the two democratic bellwethers , state leader hill and tammany boss murphy , were saying nothing openly against hearst but industriously boosting their own favorites , murphy being for cleveland and hill for parker .	92.50614
they had lost twice with the radical bryan , and were having no part of hearst , whom they considered more radical than bryan .	79.91079
but his increasing strength in the west looked menacing .	2.2802625
it caused henry watterson to sound a blast in his louisville courier-journal	4.7003694
`` does any sane democrat believe that mr . hearst , a person unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues , without a word or act in the public life of his country , past or present , that can be shown to be his to commend him , could by any possibility be elected president of the united states ? ?	56.259636
more splenetic was senator edward carmack of tennessee , a parker man .	45.748707
`` the nomination of hearst would compass the ruin of the party ' ' , carmack said .	11.85543
`` it would be a disgrace , and , as i have already said to the people of tennessee , if hearst is nominated , we may as well pen a dispatch , and send it back from the field of battle ' all is lost , including our honor ' ' ' .	68.35898
a lone pro-hearst voice from new york city was that of william devery , who had been expelled as a tammany leader but still claimed strong influence in his own district .	37.09926
`` i understand [ hearst ] is a candidate for presidential honors ' ' , devery said without cracking a smile .	34.108917
`` there ' s nothing like buildin ' from the bottom up .	119.56865
if he ' s going to the st . louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it .	34.898766
he ' s got a lot of friends , and he ought to come along and let us know if he wants our help ' ' .	40.16032
hearst won the iowa state convention , but ran into a bitter battle in indiana before losing to parker , drawing an angry statement from indiana ' s john w . kern	43.434013
`` we are menaced for the first time in the history of the republic by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase the presidential nomination .	24.058006
our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents and retainers .	57.683445
as for the paid hessians from other states , we are here to instruct the indiana democracy in their duty , i have nothing but contempt .	59.516983
the hearst dollar mark is all over them .	4.125883
the talk of a hearst `` barrel ' ' was increasing .	26.373766
another indiana observer later commented , `` perhaps we shall never know how much was spent ( by hearst ) , but if as much money was expended elsewhere as in indiana a liberal fortune was squandered ' ' .	62.085373
in his fight for the illinois and indiana delegations , hearst made several trips to chicago to confer with andrew lawrence , the former san francisco examiner man who was now his chicago kingpin , and once to meet with bryan .	42.255173
on one visit he stopped at the office of the american , where he was known surreptitiously as `` the great white chief ' ' , and for the first time met his managing editor , fat moses koenigsberg .	40.312706
koenigsberg never did learn what hearst wanted , for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door .	40.52901
`` never mind , thank you ' ' , he said .	3.4867435
`` i must hurry to catch my train ' ' .	1.4604046
another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle of letters that had accumulated for him , saying , `` but mr . hearst , what shall i do with this correspondence ' ' ? ?	32.646675
`` i ' ll show you ' ' , hearst replied , grinning .	12.885203
he took the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket .	32.175877
every letter answers itself in a couple of weeks ' ' .	8.370517
hearst hopped into a private railroad car with max ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and southern states , always wearing a frock coat , listening intently to local politicians , and generally making a good impression .	36.454277
he laughed at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated .	16.371645
`` i should , of course ' ' , he said , `` like any other man , be honored and gratified should the democrats see fit to nominate me .	35.229923
but i do not have to be bribed by office to be a democrat .	44.47966
i have supported the democratic party in the last five campaigns .	90.83041
i supported cleveland three times and bryan twice .	52.814167
i intend to support the nominee of the party at st . louis , whoever he may be ' ' .	31.991335
the hearst press followed the chief ' s progress at the various state conventions with its usual admiring attention , stressing the `` enthusiasm ' ' and `` loyalty ' ' he inspired .	36.863605
this was historic in its way , for it marked the first time an american presidential aspirant had advertised his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land .	44.444923
yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value .	414.18268
when nan patterson , a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who had appeared in a floradora road show , rode down broadway in a hansom cab with her married lover , frank young , she stopped the cab to disclose that young had been shot dead , tearfully insisting that he had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so .	54.060356
trevelyan ' s liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit , a deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty .	110.024086
his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure of garibaldi ' s exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation in the events described .	51.55887
the three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic of trevelyan ' s prose which remained conspicuous through his later works -- a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority .	73.700966
the confused rambling of guerrilla warfare , such as most of garibaldi ' s campaigns were , was brought to life by trevelyan ' s pen in some of the best passages in the books .	34.919044
his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result , but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities .	116.77184
military knowledge , love of detail , and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added ingredients .	124.31987
but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story .	33.87624
trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject .	51.7074
the outstanding example was in garibaldi and the thousand , where he made use of unpublished papers of lord john russell and english consular materials to reveal the motives which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross the straits of messina .	50.443714
in looking back over the volumes , it is possible to find errors of interpretation , some of which were not so evident at the time of writing .	31.40917
thus trevelyan repeats the story which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto at the insistence of general radetzky .	13.262765
later research has shown this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false .	31.904333
trevelyan accepts italian nationalism with little analysis , he is unduly critical of papal and french policy , and he is more than generous in assessing british policy .	40.965927
but fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification of italy , a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at the time of publication .	22.65876
trevelyan ' s manin and the venetian revolution of 1848 , his last major volume on an italian theme , was written in a minor key .	63.07174
published in 1923 , it did not gain the popular acclaim of the garibaldi volumes , probably because trevelyan felt less at home with manin , the bourgeois lawyer , than with garibaldi , the filibuster .	49.646397
the complexities of venetian politics eluded him , but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures , with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of the part played by its leading figure .	61.137875
if it is not one of his best books , it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his own garibaldi .	91.57664
already trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english figures of the same period .	57.590115
first the life of john bright appeared and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill .	160.40022
of the two , the life of bright is incomparably the better biography .	97.42691
trevelyan centers too exclusively on bright , is insufficiently appreciative of the views of bright ' s opponents and critics , and makes light of the genuine difficulties faced by peel .	47.76613
yet he is right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man , his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength .	23.137932
in the story of bright and the corn law agitation , the crimean war , the american civil war , and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which enabled this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so long .	60.736332
because bright ' s speeches were so much a part of him , there are long and numerous quotations , which , far from making the biography diffuse , help to give us the feel of the man .	61.02923
associated in a sense with the manchester school through his mother ' s family , trevelyan conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive .	53.03616
nineteenth-century virtues , however , seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular .	39.058434
the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all .	58.30115
it is a whig history of the `` tory reaction ' ' which preceded the reform bill of 1832 , and it uses the figure of grey to give some unity to the narrative .	33.645275
the volume is a piece of passionate special pleading , written with the heat -- and often with the wisdom , it must be said -- of a liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians from 1782 to 1832 .	44.208412
the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter of discontent and repression was , he has told us , congenial to his artistic sense .	82.12596
and grey ' s northumberland background was close to trevelyan ' s own .	6.7786655
but his concentration on personalities and his categorical assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation .	31.743433
some historians have found his point of view not to their taste , others have complained that he makes the tory tradition appear `` contemptible rather than intelligible ' ' , while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the `` intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which , at times , politicians are the ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents ' ' .	41.253635
the liberal-radical heritage which informs all of trevelyan ' s interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues and oversimplified the period .	33.022038
research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to a more ambitious work .	53.41084
britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook designed `` to give the sense of continuous growth , to show how economic led to social , and social to political change , how the political events reacted on the economic and social , and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process ' ' .	89.92429
the plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832 .	52.684704
more temperately than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias , trevelyan vividly sketches the england of pre-french revolution days , portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors , and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus .	69.54755
by what one reader called a `` series of dissolving views ' ' , he merges one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth .	46.030502
but after 1832 , the narrative tends to lose its balanced , many-sided quality and to become a medley of topics , often unconnected by any single thread .	31.522585
economic analysis was never trevelyan ' s strong point and the england of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis .	105.318954
yet after 1832 , the interrelations of economic and social and political affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional political account .	43.012913
finally , the period after 1870 receives little attention and that quite superficial .	71.76432
yet britain in the nineteenth century became the vade mecum of beginning students of history , went through edition after edition , and continues to be reprinted up to the very present .	57.026424
its success is a tribute , above all , to trevelyan ' s brilliance as a literary stylist .	28.736673
in 1924 trevelyan traveled to the united states , where he delivered the lowell lectures at harvard university .	12.431619
these lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of english development which took form afterward as a history of england .	124.73678
in short order , the general history became his most popular work and has remained , aside from his later social history , the work most widely favored by the public .	141.73079
the history of england has often been compared with green ' s short history .	165.48341
like green , trevelyan aimed to write a history not of `` english kings or english conquests ' ' , but of the english people .	40.234776
the history takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other than english schoolboys , and like britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes beyond 1870 .	57.64861
trevelyan ' s excursions into contemporary history were rarely happy ones .	64.53922
but as a stimulating , provocative interpretation of the broad sweep of english development it is incomparable .	28.064028
living pictures of the early boroughs , country life in tudor and stuart times , the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language and literature , the common law , parliamentary development .	41.82932
the strength of the history is also its weakness .	38.9411
trevelyan is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and character over those of other peoples .	55.031143
his nationalism was not a new characteristic , but its self-consciousness , even its self-satisfaction , is more obvious in a book that stretches over the long reach of english history .	35.23944
and yet the elements which capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the english story worth telling and worth remembering .	121.24674
tolerance and compromise , social justice and civil liberty , are today too often in short supply for one to be overly critical of trevelyan ' s emphasis on their central place in the english tradition .	90.69944
like most major works of synthesis , the history of england is informed by the positive views of a first-class mind , and this is surely a major work .	54.564953
four years after the publication of the history of england , the first volume of trevelyan ' s queen anne trilogy appeared .	10.185873
by now he had become regius professor of modern history at cambridge and had been honored by the award of the order of merit .	30.988552
his academic duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen .	4.6171536
blenheim was followed in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession , the three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne .	64.069954
like his volume on wycliffe , the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents , in this case illustrative of the history of queen anne ' s reign down to 1707 .	25.93358
trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where macaulay ' s history of england had broken off .	58.67159
in addition , he believed in the `` dramatic unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 , lying between the stuart and hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own ' ' .	24.018959
he saw the age as one in which britain `` settled her free constitution ' ' and attained her modern place in the world .	92.20628
to most observers , there is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon the years of anne ' s reign which in reality existed only in the pages of his history .	50.083687
of the three volumes , blenheim is easily the best .	119.47689
in four opening chapters reminiscent of macaulay ' s famous third chapter , trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening of the eighteenth century .	21.433247
his delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life .	109.86765
he tends to underestimate -- or perhaps to view charitably -- the brutality and the violence of the age , so that there is an idyllic quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality .	40.71376
yet as an evocation of time past , there are few such successful portraits in english historical literature .	77.354416
once the scene is set , trevelyan skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim .	15.963292
the account of the battle is , next to his descriptions of garibaldi ' s campaigns , trevelyan ' s outstanding military narrative .	26.672045
the scene is etched in sharp detail , the military problems brilliantly explained , and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident .	108.24954
if only for this modest masterpiece of military history , blenheim is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the marlborough wars .	60.24173
ramillies and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than blenheim and much less of its dramatic unity .	68.25049
yet in several chapters on scotland in the eighteenth century , trevelyan copes persuasively with the tangled confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background of scottish religion , customs , and traditions .	14.879101
i stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces .	46.54722
questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities .	67.612526
after making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the rhine into germany .	36.31551
`` may we come with you ' ' ? ?	2.1786938
`` well , i might not get that far ' ' , i told them , `` as actually i have no papers to enter germany and , as a matter of fact , no permit to return to france once i leave ' ' .	34.317307
we would all meet at ten o ' clock at the kehl bridge , five miles from strasbourg , and march triumphantly across into germany .	9.710333
there was only one hitch the small town of kehl , on the other side of the rhine , was still under french jurisdiction .	15.672313
the real franco-german frontier was beyond the town ' s limits .	16.164434
in fact , all persons were permitted to cross the rhine into kehl , there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river .	13.289673
that evening , as i learned later , the students , enjoying that spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students , surged out onto the streets of strasbourg , overturning empty streetcars , marking up store fronts , and shouting imprudently , `` garry davis to power ' ' ! !	31.834488
as i got off the trolley at kehl bridge the next morning , i was met by what looked like 5 , 000 students , some of whom were carrying sticks apparently for the coming `` battle ' ' with the police .	48.98225
alarmed by this display of weapons , i looked toward the bridge and there saw , stretched across the near side , a cordon of policemen , their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several french officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby .	77.77702
`` listen please ' ' , i called to the students in french .	101.65861
`` i thank you most heartily for being here .	32.542233
this is full evidence of your support for my principles .	194.26167
these principles , however , will not be served by violence in any form .	74.921295
if they are right , they will prevail of and by themselves .	262.28012
i ask you all to support me in this .	75.39702
if one finger is raised against the authorities , all our moral power will vanish .	78.316574
your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what i am saying .	37.262196
i marched up to the waiting officials , the students massed behind me .	101.79752
as usual , the press photographers were on hand .	9.095895
the waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade , and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france .	40.330616
i replied in the affirmative , taking out my recently acquired titre d ' identite et de voyage , on which was stamped a permission to leave france .	44.661755
he examined it carefully , handed it back and said , `` eh bien , you may leave france ' ' .	15.868592
one of the uniformed officers stepped in my way , demanding to know whether i had permission to enter germany .	25.897572
`` no , i have no permission to enter germany ' ' , i told him .	7.695605
`` alors , you may go no farther ' ' , he said imperiously .	5.1337795
`` is this then the frontier ' ' ? ?	4.1484814
at this , the students let out a yell , knowing full well the actual frontier was beyond the town of kehl .	78.7084
`` but i have no permission to re-enter france , and i have just left ' ' , i told him .	13.87145
`` i must then be standing on the line between france and germany ' ' .	18.530308
but there is no line between france and germany , that is , no actual line .	87.55955
`` but if there is no line , how can there be two countries ? ?	105.633545
you have just given me permission to leave france , which i did .	25.700556
and as you know , i have no permission to re-enter france once out .	20.732252
obviously i ' m stuck on the line between the two countries ' ' .	24.19657
the students were laughing uproariously at this piece of logic , and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile .	60.985188
`` mais non ' ' , the interior ministry man coaxed , `` you may come back to strasbourg , now , if you wish ' ' .	28.462013
then will you give me a visa to re-enter france ' ' ? ?	3.0392833
but there is no question of a visa .	5.9518065
`` ah , then please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here ' ' -- i indicated the french occupation officer -- `` informs me that germany is just on the other side of him ' ' .	61.93357
the interior man looked uneasily at his french compatriot .	3.0093422
from the crowd were coming cries of `` he ' s right ' ' ! !	20.611942
`` there must be a line ' ' ! !	8.2776575
and `` bravo , garry , continue ' ' ! !	7.3363733
seeing their hesitation , i said , `` well , until i have permission to enter germany , or a visa to re-enter france , i shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries ' ' , whereupon i moved to the side of the road , parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on the sidewalk , sat down , took out my typewriter , and began typing the above conversation .	29.78026
the reporters were questioning the interior man and the french officer , both of whom remained noncommittal as to what action , if any , would be taken in my regard .	54.035122
finally they went off to file their stories , after the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil .	30.819284
the students crowded around asking questions , slapping me on the back , and generally being friendly .	102.288246
`` but what will you do this evening , mr . davis ' ' ? ?	14.6548395
`` it will be very cold ' ' .	2.1070101
`` i don ' t know ' ' , i told him , `` except that i will be here ' ' .	13.50652
`` i shall see about getting you a tent ' ' , he said .	10.472005
`` i have a small sports shop in strasbourg ' ' .	2.5291216
that would be a great help , i told him , thanking him for his thoughtfulness .	16.118418
a special guard was posted at my end of the bridge to make sure i didn ' t cross , the ludicrousness of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else -- men , women , and children , dogs , cats , horses , cars , trucks , baby carriages -- could cross kehl bridge into kehl without surveillance .	35.872437
the day passed eventfully enough , with a constant stream of visitors , some stopping only to say hello , others getting into serious conversations , such as one andre fuchs , a free-lance journalist from strasbourg who wrote an article for the nouvelle alsatian in highly sympathetic terms .	32.342575
some students from the university returned around six with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week .	123.649925
a volunteer food brigade had been arranged , they told me , which would supply me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge .	59.267258
a little later , the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent .	38.88203
one of the girl students , sitting by while i ate the thick soup , asked me if i had a sleeping bag .	26.570747
when i informed her that i didn ' t , she said she would borrow her brother ' s and bring it to me later that evening .	59.188602
`` you do not know me ' ' , she said in good english , `` but my mother was your governess in philadelphia when you were a child ' ' .	30.242409
i was delighted to make that personal contact in such trying and unusual circumstances .	101.87751
the peter family proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days , mrs . peter , little esther , and raoul , who generously lent me his sleeping bag for my `` watch on the rhine ' ' .	20.729242
sighting a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side , i pitched the tent that evening on the stateless `` line ' ' , digging a small trench around it as best i could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child .	48.654526
the wind from the rhine was damp and chill , necessitating a fire for warmth .	12.329204
after scouring around a bit in the open area , i came across what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly , giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky .	46.26556
each evening the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits pains , esther usually being among them .	59.306244
i had advised friends to write me to `` no man ' s land , pont kehl , between strasbourg and kehl , france-germany ' ' .	21.01679
sure enough , mail began trickling in , delivered by a talkative , highly amused french postman who informed me there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized .	51.570694
on christmas eve , students brought out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the tent .	44.78222
as the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural playground for the kids of the neighborhood , i had made many friends among them , taking part in their after-school games and trying desperately to translate grimm ' s fairy tales into an understandable french as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent .	36.44519
to my great surprise and delight , when they saw the two trees they went rushing off , returning shortly with decorations from their own trees .	88.337524
it was a merry if somewhat soggy christmas for me that year .	66.938
in the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of cologne , heidelberg , and baden-baden .	4.702095
twenty thousand world citizens at stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town .	35.74767
when dr . adenauer was approached by a world citizen delegation to find out his disposition of my case , he gave them his personal approval of my entry , saying that all men advocating peace should be welcomed into germany .	64.38844
the special guard , however , was still posted on kehl bridge .	10.566977
as it began raining at around eight o ' clock on december 26th , i retired into my tent early , somewhat tired and discouraged , my body reacting sluggishly because of the continued exposure .	58.113777
no matter how large the fire , i couldn ' t seem to shake off the chill that day .	14.762768
`` oh , mr . davis , are you there ' ' ? ?	18.675001
a voice drifted in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after i had fallen into a fitful sleep .	16.069939
`` we ' re from the council of europe , british delegation .	58.627964
may we have a word with you ' ' ? ?	2.6800182
i ' ve had a trying day and i just can ' t make it out again ' ' , i told them .	32.792217
later i learned that sir hugh dalton had expressed a desire to see me , hence their trip to `` no man ' s land ' ' .	54.854404
on the evening of december 27th , esther noticed my pallid look and rasping voice .	18.647638
she entreated me to see a doctor , and when i refused , brought one out to see me .	88.89359
i wouldn ' t hear of it because it meant giving up the `` line ' ' , though i realized i was in poor shape physically .	107.21455
esther , mistaking my hesitation , assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in strasbourg whom she had already approached .	105.933624
`` no , it ' s not that ' ' , i told her .	18.424614
`` you see , once i relinquish the position i ' ve already established here , i couldn ' t regain it without sacrificing the logic of it ' ' .	27.108978
at that moment , up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from basel , switzerland .	40.397846
without preliminaries , esther asked him , `` if you are a world citizen , will you take garry davis ' place in his tent while he goes to the hospital ' ' ? ?	39.387424
`` but of course , with pleasure ' ' , he replied .	4.354677
`` what is your name ' ' ? ?	1.0068086
`` you have just enlisted for the ' rhine campaign ' ' ' .	21.317831
esther jumped up , ran to him and gave him a little hug .	12.837307
now come , garry , we must go quickly .	479.09906
such were the incongruities of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me were drafted into driving me to the strasbourg hospital while world citizen jean babel waved adieu from the `` line ' ' ! !	56.774307
he remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final , desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy .	27.319832
when the victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted , with his horse pressed broadside against cleburne ' s log parapet in a tangled group of infantrymen .	23.075867
his hat was gone , the tears were streaming from his eyes .	4.375833
six climactic minutes in an individual ' s life left no memory .	194.27834
eight hundred and sixty-five rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day .	106.18883
seven battle flags and fourteen officers ' swords were sent to thomas ' headquarters .	34.538822
it was the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks successfully made by either side during the atlanta campaign .	25.185305
the fourteenth regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes , among them being several men whose time of service had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment .	94.39141
the thirty-eighth regiment of ohio volunteers , one of the regiments in thomas ' first division during buell ' s command , suffered its greatest loss of the war in this action .	36.958435
a popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up stanley for this assault .	58.18684
sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall seeing thomas ride so fast .	48.074768
while thomas ' injured back led him to restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough when he had to .	160.7197
it is not in the record , but he must have galloped his horse at peach tree creek when he brought up ward ' s guns to save newton ' s crumbling line .	26.20928
while the final combat of the campaign was being worked out at jonesborough , thomas , on sherman ' s instructions , ordered slocum , now commanding the twentieth corps , to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without exposing his bridgehead to a counterattack .	34.498306
the dispatch must have been sent after sundown on september 1 .	22.765116
slocum made his reconnaissanace the next morning , found the town empty , accepted the surrender of the mayor and occupied the city a little before noon .	95.3454
on the morning of september 2 the fourth corps and the armies of the tennessee and the ohio followed the line of hardee ' s retreat .	28.86231
about noon they came up with the enemy two miles from lovejoy ' s station and deployed .	35.199684
the fourth corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line .	72.0552
that night a note written in slocum ' s hand and dated from inside the captured city came to sherman stating that the twentieth corps was in possession of atlanta .	54.340004
before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note to thomas .	65.86787
in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed on his heels .	62.05066
the cautious thomas re-examined the note and then , making up his mind that it was genuine , snapped his fingers , whistled and almost danced in his exuberance .	31.009594
the next day sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta .	63.636078
the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice .	40.49031
hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors .	11.282892
by both standards thomas had the right to be proud .	111.00711
thomas thanked his men for their tenacity of purpose , unmurmuring endurance , cheerful obedience , brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle .	45.165165
sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the larger fruits of victory .	51.261986
he supposed the military world would approve of his accomplishment .	6.1280603
whatever the military world thought , the political world approved it wholeheartedly .	113.61545
for some time , despondency in some northern quarters had been displayed in two ways -- an eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with lincoln .	40.59989
proposals were in the air for a year ' s armistice .	35.873077
lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected .	3.4941006
in the midst of this gloom , at 10 05 p . m . on september 2 , slocum ' s telegram to stanton , `` general sherman has taken atlanta ' ' , shattered the talk of a negotiated peace and boosted lincoln into the white house .	27.141088
to the republicans no victory could have been more complete .	70.13798
official congratulations showered upon sherman and his army .	70.71703
lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability , courage and perseverance .	5.1634808
he felt that this campaign would be famous in the annals of war .	22.661066
grant called it prompt , skillful and brilliant .	401.29532
halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war .	23.31365
actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure .	12.77843
next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action .	21.487907
sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from lovejoy ' s to atlanta .	18.061302
but , so far as its territorial objectives were concerned , the campaign was successful .	65.71505
within the narrow frame of military tactics , too , the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant .	67.38587
in seventeen weeks the military front was driven southward more than 100 miles .	12.559538
there was a battle on an average of once every three weeks .	115.93264
in the summary of the principal events of the campaign compiled from the official records there are only ten days which show no fighting .	123.08061
the casualties in the army of the cumberland were 22 , 807 , while for all three armies they were 37 , 081 .	51.70468
men were killed in their camps , at their meals and in their sleep .	74.53582
rifle fire often kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces .	17.7594
modern warfare was born in this campaign -- periscopes , camouflage , booby traps , land mines , extended order , trench raids , foxholes , armored cars , night attacks , flares , sharpshooters in trees , interlaced vines and treetops , which were the forerunners of barbed wire , trip wires to thwart a cavalry charge , which presaged the mine trap , and the general use of anesthetics .	17.29497
the use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers began to select tactical points by designating a spot as `` near the letter o in the word mountain ' ' .	58.576218
a few weeks later the maps were being divided into squares and a position was described as being `` about lots 239 , 247 and 272 with pickets forward as far as 196 ' ' .	42.913235
this system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them from a mobile lithograph press .	39.078674
orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement .	41.915913
sherman proved that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks .	23.895845
to the rebels it seemed as if sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets .	23.082865
the whistle of sherman ' s locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish fire .	12.001276
as always , the ranks worked out new and better tactics , but there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their military thinking .	80.51838
the fossilized , formalized , precedent-based thinking of the legendary military brain was not evident in sherman ' s armies .	35.55816
sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old .	38.00261
one of sherman ' s most serious shortcomings , however , was his mistrust of his cavalry .	23.394447
he never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it .	38.116306
then , in some way , this lack of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice .	44.201767
a horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with two pounds .	56.239384
the horseman required eleven times more than the footman .	6.99947
he would ship by rail five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country .	85.68011
already debilitated by the chattanooga starvation , the quality of sherman ' s horseflesh ran downhill as the campaign progressed .	14.090168
every recorded request by thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses .	46.632904
well led , properly organized cavalry , in its complementary role to infantry , had four functions .	68.887375
first , it could locate the enemy infantry , learn what they were doing , and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over .	81.48071
second , it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy .	13.207512
third , it could threaten at all times , and destroy when possible , the enemy communications .	104.27253
it could reach key tactical points faster than infantry and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot soldier .	95.42613
its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign .	66.48562
thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet , but his plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum mobility and with its commander stripped from it .	63.31307
sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings .	73.32701
his conception proved workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean , deft , well organized retreats with small materiel losses .	48.3792
sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways , yet garrard ' s covington raid and rousseau ' s opelika raid cut two-thirds of the rail lines he had to break and sherman lived in mortal fear of what forrest might do to his communications .	35.19434
when mcpherson pushed blindly through snake creek gap in a potentially decisive movement , the only cavalry in his van was the ninth illinois mounted infantry , totally inadequate for its role .	29.0989
it stumbled on infantry where no infantry should have been and mcpherson ' s aggressive impulse faded out , overwhelmed by fears of the unknown .	37.281044
a proper cavalry command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into one division of polk ' s army of the mississippi moving up from the direction of mobile to join johnston at dalton .	39.984962
from the night of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there was no union cavalry east of the macon railway to disclose to sherman that he was missing the greatest opportunity of his career .	43.962967
a great part of the time , thomas ' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line .	49.140587
at such times thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike him .	58.905468
it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making any disastrous mistakes .	186.47829
heat during the atlanta campaign , coupled with unsuitable clothing , caused individual irritation that was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean clothing .	20.701916
to relieve the itch and sweat galls , the men got into the water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private truce while the men went swimming .	71.3374
johnston believed that sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various fords .	30.62523
lieutenant colonel james p . brownlow , who commanded the first brigade of thomas ' first cavalry division , was ordered across one of these fords .	33.662914
the water was deep and brownlow took his troopers across naked -- except for guns , cartridge boxes and hats .	30.527973
they kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels , drove the rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men .	38.021774
most of the rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff brush than their naked pursuers .	77.81894
rank was becoming an explosive issue in all three of sherman ' s armies .	29.475822
merited recommendations from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees from civil life .	71.29249
in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of meynell , thompson told patmore of his distress at having had to leave london before this new friendship had developed further ``	129.6523
that was a very absurd and annoying situation in which i was placed by w . m . ' s curious methods of handling me .	32.138767
he never let me know that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning i was to leave for lymington .	39.794556
the result was that i found myself in the ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for the next week , only two days before my departure from london .	55.139812
luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not i ' ' .	44.805115
it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements , which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant .	75.1819
when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which included fervent verses from pantasaph , mrs . king felt a proper victorian alarm .	37.20234
some , she knew , looked upon thompson almost as a saint , but others read in `` the hound of heaven ' ' what they took to be the confessions of a great sinner , who , like oscar wilde , had -- as one pious writer later put it -- thrown himself `` on the swelling wave of every passion ' ' .	42.329666
consequently , on october 31 , 1896 , mrs . king wrote to thompson , quite against her daughter ' s wishes , asking him not to `` recommence a correspondence which i believe has been dropped for some weeks ' ' .	38.33201
katherine was staying at a convent , and her mother felt that , as thompson himself seems to have suggested , she might eventually stay there .	96.8489
this prospect did not please mrs . king any more than did the possibility that her daughter might marry a bohemian , but she used it to suggest to thompson that , `` it is not in her nature to love you ' ' .	48.88756
for his part , thompson had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an honorable friendship between katie and himself .	46.06246
at no time does he seem to have proposed marriage , and mrs . king was evidently torn between a concern for her daughter ' s emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation .	49.334995
in any case , she told thompson that she saw no reason why he might not see katie again , `` now that this frank explanation has been made & no one can misunderstand ' ' .	63.635956
she ended her letter with the assurance that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself to be an honor , from which she could not part `` without still more pain ' ' .	60.060513
after thompson came to london to live , he received a letter from katie , which was dated february 8 , 1897 .	21.908726
she regretted what she described as the `` unwarrantable & unnecessary ' ' check to their friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another perfectly .	110.7048
i am a great deal at the little children ' s hospital .	50.6968
i know you are very busy now , you are writing a great deal & your book is coming out , isn ' t it ? ?	58.76054
but if you are able & care to come , you know how glad i shall be .	76.42974
katherine douglas king ' ' the invitation was accepted and other letters followed , in which she spoke of her concern for his health and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled children she served .	111.711266
it is difficult to say what thompson expected would come of their relationship , which had begun so soon after his emotions had been stirred by maggie brien , but when katie wrote on april 11 , 1900 , to tell him that she was to be married to the rev . godfrey burr , the vicar of rushall in staffordshire , the news evidently helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes for a new volume of verse .	26.673756
in a letter to meynell , which was written in june , less than a month before katie ' s wedding , he was highly melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of returning to the life of the streets ``	33.214718
a week in arrears , and without means to pay , i must go , it is the only right thing .	56.49079
perhaps mrs . meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book , with all its mementos of her and the dear ones .	24.29445
last , not least , there are some poems which k . king sent me ( addressed to herself ) when i was preparing a fresh volume , asking me to include them .	66.142975
the terrible blow of the new year put an end to that project .	84.32795
i wish you would return them to her .	18.941101
i never had the courage to look at them , when my projected volume became hopeless , fearing they were poor , until now when i was obliged to do so .	58.602894
o my genius , young and ripening , you would swear , -- when i wrote them	128.60753
all chance of fulfilling my destiny is over .	32.149536
i want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems , dear father-brother , now i am gone	31.66982
and launch them on the world when their time comes .	71.734695
for them a box will be lodgment enough .	4.6118445
since my silence must have ended when i gave the purposed volume to you .	60.655815
i ask you to do me the last favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening , about which time i shall come to say my sad good-bye .	77.4341
if you don ' t think much of them , tell me the wholesome truth .	56.12815
if otherwise , you will give me a pleasure .	149.06581
but this -- yes , terrible step i am about to take is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found hope that here , in these poems , is treasure -- or at least some measure of beauty , which i did not know of ' ' .	49.907368
thompson , of course , was persuaded not to take the `` terrible step ' '	18.373903
meynell once again paid his debts and it was katie , rather than thompson , whose life was soon ended , for she died in childbirth in april , 1901 , in the first year of her marriage .	31.666023
the `` orphaned poems ' ' mentioned in the letter to meynell comprised a group of five sonnets , which were published in the 1913 edition of thompson ' s works under the heading `` ad amicam ' ' , plus certain other completed pieces and rough drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books .	33.727833
the publication of father connolly ' s the man has wings has made more of the group available in print so that a general picture of what it contained can now be had without difficulty .	152.8809
some of the poems express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love	292.23282
